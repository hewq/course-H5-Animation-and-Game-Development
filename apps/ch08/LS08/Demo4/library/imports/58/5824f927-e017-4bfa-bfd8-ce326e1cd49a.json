There are some common exceptions, such as unittests and small `.cpp` files containing just a `main()` function.\n\nCorrect use of header files can make a huge difference to the readability, size and performance of your code.\n\nThe following rules will guide you through the various pitfalls of using header files.\n\n## The #define Guard\n\nAll header files should have `#define` guards to prevent multiple inclusion. The format of the symbol name should be `<PROJECT>_<PATH>_<FILE>_H_.`\n\nTo guarantee uniqueness, they should be based on the full path in a project's source tree. For example, the file `cocos2dx/sprites_nodes/CCSprite.h` in project foo should have the following guard:\n\n```cpp\n#ifndef COCOS2DX_SPRITE_NODES_CCSPRITE_H_\n#define COCOS2DX_SPRITE_NODES_CCSPRITE_H_\n\n...\n\n#endif  // COCOS2DX_SPRITE_NODES_CCSPRITE_H_\n```\n\n```cpp\n// Pragma once is still open for debate\n#pragma once\n```\n\nWe are considering using `#pragma once` as well, although we haven't determined yet if it is supported in all our target platforms.\n\n## Forward Declarations\n\nYou may forward declare ordinary classes in order to avoid unnecessary `#includes`.\n\n**Definition:** A \"forward declaration\" is a declaration of a class, function, or template without an associated definition. #include lines can often be replaced with forward declarations of whatever symbols are actually used by the client code.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Unnecessary #includes force the compiler to open more files and process more input.\n* They can also force your code to be recompiled more often, due to changes in the header.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* It can be difficult to determine the correct form of a forward declaration in the presence of features like templates, typedefs, default parameters, and using declarations.\n* It can be difficult to determine whether a forward declaration or a full #include is needed for a given piece of code, particularly when implicit conversion operations are involved. In extreme cases, replacing an #include with a forward declaration can silently change the meaning of code.\n* Forward declaring multiple symbols from a header can be more verbose than simply `#include`ing the header.\n* Forward declarations of functions and templates can prevent the header owners from making otherwise-compatible changes to their APIs; for example, widening a parameter type, or adding a template parameter with a default value.\n* Forward declaring symbols from namespace std:: usually yields undefined behavior.\n* Structuring code to enable forward declarations (e.g. using pointer members instead of object members) can make the code slower and more complex.\n* The practical efficiency benefits of forward declarations are unproven.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n* When using a function declared in a header file, always #include that header.\n* When using a class template, prefer to #include its header file.\n* When using an ordinary class, relying on a forward declaration is OK, but be wary of situations where a forward declaration may be insufficient or incorrect; when in doubt, just #include the appropriate header.\n* Do not replace data members with pointers just to avoid an #include.\n\nAlways #include the file that actually provides the declarations/definitions you need; do not rely on the symbol being brought in transitively via headers not directly included. One exception is that `Myfile.cpp` may rely on #includes and forward declarations from its corresponding header file `Myfile.h`.\n\n## Inline Functions\n\nDefine functions inline only when they are small, say, 10 lines or less.\n\n**Definition:**\nYou can declare functions in a way that allows the compiler to expand them inline rather than calling them through the usual function call mechanism.\n\n**Pros:** \nInlining a function can generate more efficient object code, as long as the inlined function is small. Feel free to inline accessors and mutators, and other short, performance-critical functions.\n\n**Cons:** \nOveruse of inlining can actually make programs slower. Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause the code size to increase or decrease. Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very large function can dramatically increase code size. On modern processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use of the instruction cache.\n\n**Decision:**\nA decent rule of thumb is to not inline a function if it is more than 10 lines long. Beware of destructors, which are often longer than they appear because of implicit member- and base-destructor calls!\n\nAnother useful rule of thumb: it's typically not cost effective to inline functions with loops or switch statements (unless, in the common case, the loop or switch statement is never executed).\n\nIt is important to know that functions are not always inlined even if they are declared as such; for example, virtual and recursive functions are not normally inlined. Usually recursive functions should not be inline. The main reason for making a virtual function inline is to place its definition in the class, either for convenience or to document its behavior, e.g., for accessors and mutators.\n\n## The -inl.h Files\n\nYou may use file names with a -inl.h suffix to define complex inline functions when needed.\n\nThe definition of an inline function needs to be in a header file, so that the compiler has the definition available for inlining at the call sites. However, implementation code properly belongs in .cpp files, and we do not like to have much actual code in .h files unless there is a readability or performance advantage.\n\nIf an inline function definition is short, with very little, if any, logic in it, you should put the code in your .h file. For example, accessors and mutators should certainly be inside a class definition. More complex inline functions may also be put in a .h file for the convenience of the implementer and callers, though if this makes the .h file too unwieldy you can instead put that code in a separate -inl.h file. This separates the implementation from the class definition, while still allowing the implementation to be included where necessary.\n\nAnother use of -inl.h files is for definitions of function templates. This can be used to keep your template definitions easy to read.\n\nDo not forget that a -inl.h file requires a #define guard just like any other header file.\n\n## Function Parameter Ordering\n\nWhen defining a function, parameter order is: inputs, then outputs.\n\nParameters to C/C++ functions are either input to the function, output from the function, or both. Input parameters are usually `values` or `const references`, while output and input/output parameters will be `non-const pointers` . When ordering function parameters, put all input-only parameters before any output parameters. In particular, do not add new parameters to the end of the function just because they are new; place new input-only parameters before the output parameters.\n\nThis is not a hard-and-fast rule. Parameters that are both input and output (often classes/structs) muddy the waters, and, as always, consistency with related functions may require you to bend the rule.\n\n## Names and Order of Includes\n\nUse standard order for readability and to avoid hidden dependencies: C library, C++ library, other libraries' .h, your project's .h.\n\nAll of a project's header files should be listed as descendants of the project's source directory without use of UNIX directory shortcuts . (the current directory) or .. (the parent directory). For example, google-awesome-project/src/base/logging.h should be included as\n\n```cpp\n#include \"base/logging.h\"\n```\n\nIn `dir/foo.cpp` or `dir/foo_test.cpp`, whose main purpose is to implement or test the stuff in `dir2/foo2.h`, order your includes as follows:\n\n* dir2/foo2.h (preferred location — see details below).\n* C system files.\n* C++ system files.\n* Other libraries' .h files.\n* Your project's .h files.\n\nWith the preferred ordering, if `dir2/foo2.h` omits any necessary includes, the build of `dir/foo.cpp` or `dir/foo_test.cpp` will break. Thus, this rule ensures that build breaks show up first for the people working on these files, not for innocent people in other packages.\n\n`dir/foo.cpp` and `dir2/foo2.h` are often in the same directory (e.g. `base/basictypes_test.cpp` and `base/basictypes.h`), but can be in different directories too.\n\nWithin each section the includes should be ordered alphabetically. Note that older code might not conform to this rule and should be fixed when convenient.\n\nFor example, the includes in `cocos2dx/sprite_nodes/CCSprite.cpp` might look like this:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"sprite_nodes/CCSprite.h\"  // Preferred location.\n\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <hash_map>\n#include <vector>\n\n#include \"base/basictypes.h\"\n#include \"base/commandlineflags.h\"\n#include \"foo/public/bar.h\"\n```\n\nException: sometimes, system-specific code needs conditional includes. Such code can put conditional includes after other includes. Of course, keep your system-specific code small and localized. Example:\n\n```cpp\n#include \"foo/public/fooserver.h\"\n\n#include \"base/port.h\" \n\n// For LANG_CXX11.\n#ifdef LANG_CXX11\n#include <initializer_list>\n#endif  // LANG_CXX11\n```\n\n# Scoping\n\n## Namespaces\n\nUnnamed namespaces in `.cpp` files are encouraged. With named namespaces, choose the name based on the project, and possibly its path. Do not use a using-directive. Do not use inline namespaces. \n\n**Definition:**\nNamespaces subdivide the global scope into distinct, named scopes, and so are useful for preventing name collisions in the global scope.\n\n**Pros:**\nNamespaces provide a (hierarchical) axis of naming, in addition to the (also hierarchical) name axis provided by classes.\n\nFor example, if two different projects have a class Foo in the global scope, these symbols may collide at compile time or at runtime. If each project places their code in a namespace, project1::Foo and project2::Foo are now distinct symbols that do not collide.\n\nInline namespaces automatically place their names in the enclosing scope. Consider the following snippet, for example:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace X {\ninline namespace Y {\n  void foo();\n}\n}\n```\nThe expressions `X::Y::foo()` and `X::foo()` are interchangeable. Inline namespaces are primarily intended for ABI compatibility across versions. \n\n**Cons:**\nNamespaces can be confusing, because they provide an additional (hierarchical) axis of naming, in addition to the (also hierarchical) name axis provided by classes.\n\nInline namespaces, in particular, can be confusing because names aren't actually restricted to the namespace where they are declared. They are only useful as part of some larger versioning policy. \n\nUse of unnamed namespaces in header files can easily cause violations of the C++ One Definition Rule (ODR).\n\n**Decision:**\nUse namespaces according to the policy described below. Terminate namespaces with comments as shown in the given examples.\n\n### Unnamed Namespaces\n\nUnnamed namespaces are allowed and even encouraged in .cpp files, to avoid runtime naming conflicts:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace {                           // This is in a .cpp file.\n\n// The content of a namespace is not indented\nenum { UNUSED, EOF, ERROR };         // Commonly used tokens.\nbool atEof() { return _pos == EOF; }  // Uses our namespace's EOF.\n\n}  // namespace\n```\n\nHowever, file-scope declarations that are associated with a particular class may be declared in that class as types, static data members or static member functions rather than as members of an unnamed namespace.\nDo not use unnamed namespaces in .h files.\n\n### Named Namespaces\n\nNamed namespaces should be used as follows:\n\nNamespaces wrap the entire source file after includes, gflags definitions/declarations, and forward declarations of classes from other namespaces:\n\n\n```cpp\n// In the .h file\n// When using the cocos2d namespace\nNS_CC_BEGIN\n\n// All declarations are within the namespace scope.\n// Notice the lack of indentation.\nclass MyClass\n{\npublic:\n    ...\n    void foo();\n};\n\nNS_CC_END\n```\n\n\n```cpp\n// In the .h file\n// When NOT using the cocos2d namespace\nnamespace mynamespace {\n\n// All declarations are within the namespace scope.\n// Notice the lack of indentation.\nclass MyClass\n{\npublic:\n    ...\n    void foo();\n};\n\n}  // namespace mynamespace\n```\n\n```cpp\n// In the .cpp file\nnamespace mynamespace {\n\n// Definition of functions is within scope of the namespace.\nvoid MyClass::foo()\n{\n    ...\n}\n\n}  // namespace mynamespace\n```\n\nThe typical .cpp file might have more complex detail, including the need to reference classes in other namespaces.\n\n```cpp\n#include \"a.h\"\n\nDEFINE_bool(someflag, false, \"dummy flag\");\n\nclass C;  // Forward declaration of class C in the global namespace.\nnamespace a { class A; }  // Forward declaration of a::A.\n\nnamespace b {\n\n...code for b...         // Code goes against the left margin.\n\n}  // namespace b\n```\n\n* Do not declare anything in namespace std, not even forward declarations of standard library classes. Declaring entities in namespace std is undefined behavior, i.e., not portable. To declare entities from the standard library, include the appropriate header file.\nYou may not use a using-directive to make all names from a namespace available.\n\n```cpp\n// Forbidden -- This pollutes the namespace.\nusing namespace foo;\n```\n\n* You may use a using-declaration anywhere in a .cpp file, and in functions, methods or classes in .h files.\n\n```cpp\n// OK in .cpp files.\n// Must be in a function, method or class in .h files.\nusing ::foo::bar;\n```\n\n* Namespace aliases are allowed anywhere in a .cpp file, anywhere inside the named namespace that wraps an entire .h file, and in functions and methods.\n\n```cpp\n// Shorten access to some commonly used names in .cpp files.\nnamespace fbz = ::foo::bar::baz;\n\n// Shorten access to some commonly used names (in a .h file).\nnamespace librarian {\n// The following alias is available to all files including\n// this header (in namespace librarian):\n// alias names should therefore be chosen consistently\n// within a project.\nnamespace pd_s = ::pipeline_diagnostics::sidetable;\n\ninline void myInlineFunction() {\n// namespace alias local to a function (or method).\nnamespace fbz = ::foo::bar::baz;\n...\n}\n}  // namespace librarian\n```\n\nNote that an alias in a .h file is visible to everyone #including that file, so public headers (those available outside a project) and headers transitively #included by them, should avoid defining aliases, as part of the general goal of keeping public APIs as small as possible.\n\n* Do not use inline namespaces.\n\n## Nested Classes\n\nAlthough you may use public nested classes when they are part of an interface, consider a namespace to keep declarations out of the global scope.\n\n**Definition:**\nA class can define another class within it; this is also called a member class.\n\n```cpp\nclass Foo\n{\nprivate:\n    // Bar is a member class, nested within Foo.\n    class Bar\n    {\n       ...\n    };\n};\n```\n\n**Pros:**\nThis is useful when the nested (or member) class is only used by the enclosing class; making it a member puts it in the enclosing class scope rather than polluting the outer scope with the class name. Nested classes can be forward declared within the enclosing class and then defined in the .cpp file to avoid including the nested class definition in the enclosing class declaration, since the nested class definition is usually only relevant to the implementation.\n\n**Cons:**\nNested classes can be forward-declared only within the definition of the enclosing class. Thus, any header file manipulating a Foo::Bar* pointer will have to include the full class declaration for Foo.\n\n**Decision:**\nDo not make nested classes public unless they are actually part of the interface, e.g., a class that holds a set of options for some method.\n\n## Nonmember, Static Member, and Global Functions\n\nPrefer nonmember functions within a namespace or static member functions to global functions; use completely global functions rarely.\n\n**Pros:**\nNonmember and static member functions can be useful in some situations. Putting nonmember functions in a namespace avoids polluting the global namespace.\n\n**Cons:**\nNonmember and static member functions may make more sense as members of a new class, especially if they access external resources or have significant dependencies.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSometimes it is useful, or even necessary, to define a function not bound to a class instance. Such a function can be either a static member or a nonmember function. Nonmember functions should not depend on external variables, and should nearly always exist in a namespace. Rather than creating classes only to group static member functions which do not share static data, use namespaces instead.\n\nFunctions defined in the same compilation unit as production classes may introduce unnecessary coupling and link-time dependencies when directly called from other compilation units; static member functions are particularly susceptible to this. Consider extracting a new class, or placing the functions in a namespace possibly in a separate library.\n\nIf you must define a nonmember function and it is only needed in its .cpp file, use an unnamed namespace or static linkage (eg static int Foo() {...}) to limit its scope.\n\n## Local Variables\n\nPlace a function's variables in the narrowest scope possible, and initialize variables in the declaration.\n\nC++ allows you to declare variables anywhere in a function. We encourage you to declare them in as local a scope as possible, and as close to the first use as possible. This makes it easier for the reader to find the declaration and see what type the variable is and what it was initialized to. In particular, initialization should be used instead of declaration and assignment, e.g.\n\n```cpp\nint i;\ni = f();      // Bad -- initialization separate from declaration.\n\nint j = g();  // Good -- declaration has initialization.\n\nvector<int> v;\nv.push_back(1);  // Prefer initializing using brace initialization.\nv.push_back(2);\n\nvector<int> v = {1, 2};  // Good -- v starts initialized.\n```\n\nNote that gcc implements `for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)` correctly (the scope of i is only the scope of the for loop), so you can then reuse i in another for loop in the same scope. It also correctly scopes declarations in if and while statements, e.g.\n\n```cpp\nwhile (const char* p = strchr(str, '/')) str = p + 1;\n```\n\nThere is one caveat: if the variable is an object, its constructor is invoked every time it enters scope and is created, and its destructor is invoked every time it goes out of scope.\n\n```cpp\n// Inefficient implementation:\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {\n    Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called 1000000 times each.\n    f.doSomething(i);\n}\n\nIt may be more efficient to declare such a variable used in a loop outside that loop:\n\nFoo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called once each.\nfor (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {\n    f.doSomething(i);\n}\n```\n\n## Static and Global Variables\n\nStatic or global variables of class type are forbidden: they cause hard-to-find bugs due to indeterminate order of construction and destruction. However, such variables are allowed if they are `constexpr`: they have no dynamic initialization or destruction. \n\nObjects with static storage duration, including global variables, static variables, static class member variables, and function static variables, must be Plain Old Data (POD): only ints, chars, floats, or pointers, or arrays/structs of POD.\n\nThe order in which class constructors and initializers for static variables are called is only partially specified in C++ and can even change from build to build, which can cause bugs that are difficult to find. Therefore in addition to banning globals of class type, we do not allow static POD variables to be initialized with the result of a function, unless that function (such as getenv(), or getpid()) does not itself depend on any other globals.\n\nLikewise, global and static variables are destroyed when the program terminates, regardless of whether the termination is by returning from `main()` or by calling `exit()`. The order in which destructors are called is defined to be the reverse of the order in which the constructors were called. Since constructor order is indeterminate, so is destructor order. For example, at program-end time a static variable might have been destroyed, but code still running — perhaps in another thread — tries to access it and fails. Or the destructor for a static `string` variable might be run prior to the destructor for another variable that contains a reference to that string. \n\nOne way to alleviate the destructor problem is to terminate the program by calling `quick_exit()` instead of `exit()`. The difference is that `quick_exit()` does not invoke destructors and does not invoke any handlers that were registered by calling `atexit()`. If you have a handler that needs to run when a program terminates via `quick_exit()` (flushing logs, for example), you can register it `using at_quick_exit()`. (If you have a handler that needs to run at both exit() and quick_exit(), you need to register it in both places.) \n\nAs a result we only allow static variables to contain POD data. This rule completely disallows vector (use C arrays instead), or string (use const char []).\n\nIf you need a static or global variable of a class type, consider initializing a pointer (which will never be freed), from either your main() function or from pthread_once(). Note that this must be a raw pointer, not a \"smart\" pointer, since the smart pointer's destructor will have the order-of-destructor issue that we are trying to avoid.\n\n# Classes\n\nClasses are the fundamental unit of code in C++. Naturally, we use them extensively. This section lists the main dos and don'ts you should follow when writing a class.\n\n## Doing Work in Constructors\n\nAvoid doing complex initialization in constructors (in particular, initialization that can fail or that requires virtual method calls).\n\n**Definition:**\nIt is possible to perform initialization in the body of the constructor.\n\n**Pros:**\nConvenience in typing. No need to worry about whether the class has been initialized or not.\n\n**Cons:**\nThe problems with doing work in constructors are:\n\n* There is no easy way for constructors to signal errors, short of using exceptions (which are forbidden).\n* If the work fails, we now have an object whose initialization code failed, so it may be an indeterminate state.\n* If the work calls virtual functions, these calls will not get dispatched to the subclass implementations. Future modification to your class can quietly introduce this problem even if your class is not currently subclassed, causing much confusion.\n* If someone creates a global variable of this type (which is against the rules, but still), the constructor code will be called before main(), possibly breaking some implicit assumptions in the constructor code. For instance, gflags will not yet have been initialized.\n\n**Decision:** Constructors should never call virtual functions or attempt to raise non-fatal failures. If your object requires non-trivial initialization, consider using a factory function or Init() method.\n\n## Initialization\n\nIf your class defines member variables, you must provide an in-class initializer for every member variable or write a constructor (which can be a default constructor). If you do not declare any constructors yourself then the compiler will generate a default constructor for you, which may leave some fields uninitialized or initialized to inappropriate values.\n\n**Definition:** The default constructor is called when we new a class object with no arguments. It is always called when calling `new[]` (for arrays). In-class member initialization means declaring a member variable using a construction like `int _count = 17;` or `string name_{\"abc\"};`, as opposed to just `int _count;` or `string _name;`.\n\n**Pros:**\n\nA user defined default constructor is used to initialize an object if no initializer is provided. It can ensure that an object is always in a valid and usable state as soon as it's constructed; it can also ensure that an object is initially created in an obviously \"impossible\" state, to aid debugging.\n\nIn-class member initialization ensures that a member variable will be initialized appropriately without having to duplicate the initialization code in multiple constructors. This can reduce bugs where you add a new member variable, initialize it in one constructor, and forget to put that initialization code in another constructor.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nExplicitly defining a default constructor is extra work for you, the code writer.\n\nIn-class member initialization is potentially confusing if a member variable is initialized as part of its declaration and also initialized in a constructor, since the value in the constructor will override the value in the declaration.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nUse in-class member initialization for simple initializations, especially when a member variable must be initialized the same way in more than one constructor.\n\nIf your class defines member variables that aren't initialized in-class, and if it has no other constructors, you must define a default constructor (one that takes no arguments). It should preferably initialize the object in such a way that its internal state is consistent and valid.\n\nThe reason for this is that if you have no other constructors and do not define a default constructor, the compiler will generate one for you. This compiler generated constructor may not initialize your object sensibly.\n\nIf your class inherits from an existing class but you add no new member variables, you are not required to have a default constructor.\n\n\nThe reason for this is that if you have no other constructors and do not define a default constructor, the compiler will generate one for you. This compiler generated constructor may not initialize your object sensibly.\n\nIf your class inherits from an existing class but you add no new member variables, you are not required to have a default constructor.\n\n## Explicit Constructors\n\nUse the C++ keyword explicit for constructors with one argument.\n\n**Definition:**\n Normally, if a constructor takes one argument, it can be used as a conversion. For instance, if you define Foo::Foo(string name) and then pass a string to a function that expects a Foo, the constructor will be called to convert the string into a Foo and will pass the Foo to your function for you. This can be convenient but is also a source of trouble when things get converted and new objects created without you meaning them to. Declaring a constructor explicit prevents it from being invoked implicitly as a conversion.\n\n**Pros:**\nAvoids undesirable conversions.\n\n**Cons:**\nNone.\n\n**Decision:**\nWe require all single argument constructors to be explicit. Always put explicit in front of one-argument constructors in the class definition: explicit Foo(string name);\n\nThe exception is copy constructors, which, in the rare cases when we allow them, should probably not be explicit. Classes that are intended to be transparent wrappers around other classes are also exceptions. Such exceptions should be clearly marked with comments.\n\nFinally, constructors that take only an initializer_list may be non-explicit. This is to permit construction of your type using the assignment form for brace init lists (i.e. `MyType m = {1, 2}` ).\n\n## Copy Constructors\n\nProvide a copy constructor and assignment operator only when necessary. Otherwise, disable them with `DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN`.\n\n**Definition:**\nThe copy constructor and assignment operator are used to create copies of objects. The copy constructor is implicitly invoked by the compiler in some situations, e.g. passing objects by value.\n\n**Pros:**\nCopy constructors make it easy to copy objects. STL containers require that all contents be copyable and assignable. Copy constructors can be more efficient than CopyFrom()-style workarounds because they combine construction with copying, the compiler can elide them in some contexts, and they make it easier to avoid heap allocation.\n\n**Cons:**\nImplicit copying of objects in C++ is a rich source of bugs and of performance problems. It also reduces readability, as it becomes hard to track which objects are being passed around by value as opposed to by reference, and therefore where changes to an object are reflected.\n\n**Decision:**\nFew classes need to be copyable. Most should have neither a copy constructor nor an assignment operator. In many situations, a pointer or reference will work just as well as a copied value, with better performance. For example, you can pass function parameters by reference or pointer instead of by value, and you can store pointers rather than objects in an STL container.\n\nIf your class needs to be copyable, prefer providing a copy method, such as `clone()`, rather than a copy constructor, because such methods cannot be invoked implicitly. If a copy method is insufficient in your situation (e.g. for performance reasons, or because your class needs to be stored by value in an STL container), provide both a copy constructor and assignment operator.\n\nIf your class does not need a copy constructor or assignment operator, you must explicitly disable them. To do so, add dummy declarations for the copy constructor and assignment operator in the private: section of your class, but do not provide any corresponding definition (so that any attempt to use them results in a link error).\n\nFor convenience, a `DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN` macro can be used:\n\n```cpp\n// A macro to disallow the copy constructor and operator= functions\n// This should be used in the private: declarations for a class\n#define DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN(TypeName) \\\n  TypeName(const TypeName&);               \\\n  void operator=(const TypeName&)\n```\n\nThen, in class Foo:\n\n```cpp\nclass Foo\n{\npublic:\n    Foo(int f);\n    ~Foo();\n\nprivate:\n    DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN(Foo);\n};\n```\n\n## Delegating and inheriting constructors\n\nUse delegating and inheriting constructors when they reduce code duplication.\n\n**Definition:**\n\nDelegating and inheriting constructors are two different features, both introduced in C++11, for reducing code duplication in constructors. Delegating constructors allow one of a class's constructors to forward work to one of the class's other constructors, using a special variant of the initialization list syntax. For example:\n\n```cpp\nX::X(const string& name) : name_(name) {\n  ...\n}\n\nX::X() : X(\"\") { }\n```\n\nInheriting constructors allow a derived class to have its base class's constructors available directly, just as with any of the base class's other member functions, instead of having to redeclare them. This is especially useful if the base has multiple constructors. For example:\n\n```cpp\nclass Base {\npublic:\n\tBase();\n\tBase(int n);\n\tBase(const string& s);\n\t...\n};\n\nclass Derived : public Base {\npublic:\n\tusing Base::Base;  // Base's constructors are redeclared here.\n};\n```\n\nThis is especially useful when Derived's constructors don't have to do anything more than calling Base's constructors.\n\n**Pros:**\n\nDelegating and inheriting constructors reduce verbosity and boilerplate, which can improve readability.\n\nDelegating constructors are familiar to Java programmers.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nIt's possible to approximate the behavior of delegating constructors by using a helper function.\n\nInheriting constructors may be confusing if a derived class introduces new member variables, since the base class constructor doesn't know about them.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nUse delegating and inheriting constructors when they reduce boilerplate and improve readability. Be cautious about inheriting constructors when your derived class has new member variables. Inheriting constructors may still be appropriate in that case if you can use in-class member initialization for the derived class's member variables.\n\n\n## Structs vs. Classes\n\nUse a struct only for passive objects that carry data; everything else is a class.\n\nThe struct and class keywords behave almost identically in C++. We add our own semantic meanings to each keyword, so you should use the appropriate keyword for the data-type you're defining.\n\nstructs should be used for passive objects that carry data, and may have associated constants, but lack any functionality other than access/setting the data members. The accessing/setting of fields is done by directly accessing the fields rather than through method invocations. Methods should not provide behavior but should only be used to set up the data members, e.g., constructor, destructor, Initialize(), Reset(), Validate().\n\nIf more functionality is required, a class is more appropriate. If in doubt, make it a class.\n\nFor consistency with STL, you can use struct instead of class for functors and traits.\n\nNote that member variables in structs and classes have different naming rules.\n\n## Inheritance\n\nComposition is often more appropriate than inheritance. When using inheritance, make it public.\n\n**Definition:**\nWhen a sub-class inherits from a base class, it includes the definitions of all the data and operations that the parent base class defines. In practice, inheritance is used in two major ways in C++: implementation inheritance, in which actual code is inherited by the child, and interface inheritance, in which only method names are inherited.\n\n**Pros:**\nImplementation inheritance reduces code size by re-using the base class code as it specializes an existing type. Because inheritance is a compile-time declaration, you and the compiler can understand the operation and detect errors. Interface inheritance can be used to programmatically enforce that a class expose a particular API. Again, the compiler can detect errors, in this case, when a class does not define a necessary method of the API.\n\n**Cons:**\nFor implementation inheritance, because the code implementing a sub-class is spread between the base and the sub-class, it can be more difficult to understand an implementation. The sub-class cannot override functions that are not virtual, so the sub-class cannot change implementation. The base class may also define some data members, so that specifies physical layout of the base class.\n\n**Decision:**\nAll inheritance should be public. If you want to do private inheritance, you should be including an instance of the base class as a member instead.\n\nDo not overuse implementation inheritance. Composition is often more appropriate. Try to restrict use of inheritance to the \"is-a\" case: Bar subclasses Foo if it can reasonably be said that Bar \"is a kind of\" Foo.\n\nMake your destructor virtual if necessary. If your class has virtual methods, its destructor should be virtual.\n\nLimit the use of protected to those member functions that might need to be accessed from subclasses. Note that data members should be private.\n\nWhen redefining an inherited virtual function, explicitly declare it virtual in the declaration of the derived class. Rationale: If virtual is omitted, the reader has to check all ancestors of the class in question to determine if the function is virtual or not.\n\n## Multiple Inheritance\n\nOnly very rarely is multiple implementation inheritance actually useful. We allow multiple inheritance only when at most one of the base classes has an implementation; all other base classes must be pure interface classes tagged with the Interface suffix.\n\n**Definition:** Multiple inheritance allows a sub-class to have more than one base class. We distinguish between base classes that are pure interfaces and those that have an implementation.\n\n**Pros:** Multiple implementation inheritance may let you re-use even more code than single inheritance (see Inheritance).\n\n**Cons:** Only very rarely is multiple implementation inheritance actually useful. When multiple implementation inheritance seems like the solution, you can usually find a different, more explicit, and cleaner solution.\n\n**Decision:** Multiple inheritance is allowed only when all superclasses, with the possible exception of the first one, are pure interfaces. In order to ensure that they remain pure interfaces, they must end with the Interface suffix.\n\nNote: There is an exception to this rule on Windows.\n\n## Interfaces\n\nClasses that satisfy certain conditions are allowed, but not required, to end with an `Interface` suffix.\n\n**Definition:**\n\nA class is a pure interface if it meets the following requirements:\n\n* It has only public pure virtual (\"= 0\") methods and static methods (but see below for destructor).\n* It may not have non-static data members.\n* It need not have any constructors defined. If a constructor is provided, it must take no arguments and it must be protected.\n* If it is a subclass, it may only be derived from classes that satisfy these conditions and are tagged with the Interface suffix.\n\nAn interface class can never be directly instantiated because of the pure virtual method(s) it declares. To make sure all implementations of the interface can be destroyed correctly, the interface must also declare a virtual destructor (in an exception to the first rule, this should not be pure). See Stroustrup, The C++ Programming Language, 3rd edition, section 12.4 for details.\n\n**Pros:**\nTagging a class with the `Interface` suffix lets others know that they must not add implemented methods or non static data members. This is particularly important in the case of multiple inheritance. Additionally, the interface concept is already well-understood by Java programmers.\n\n**Cons:**\nThe `Interface` suffix lengthens the class name, which can make it harder to read and understand. Also, the interface property may be considered an implementation detail that shouldn't be exposed to clients.\n\n**Decision:**\nA class may end with `Interface` only if it meets the above requirements. We do not require the converse, however: classes that meet the above requirements are not required to end with `Interface`.\n\n## Operator Overloading\n\nDo not overload operators except in rare, special circumstances.\n\n**Definition:**\nA class can define that operators such as + and / operate on the class as if it were a built-in type. An overload of `operator\"\"` allows the built-in literal syntax to be used to create objects of class types. \n\n**Pros:**\nOperator overloading can make code appear more intuitive because a class will behave in the same way as built-in types (such as int). Overloaded operators are more playful names for functions that are less-colorfully named, such as `Equals()` or `Add()`.\n\nFor some template functions to work correctly, you may need to define operators.\n\nUser-defined literals are a very concise notation for creating objects of user-defined types.\n\n**Cons:**\nWhile operator overloading can make code more intuitive, it has several drawbacks:\n\n* It can fool our intuition into thinking that expensive operations are cheap, built-in operations.\n* It is much harder to find the call sites for overloaded operators. Searching for `equals()` is much easier than searching for relevant invocations of `==`.\n* Some operators work on pointers too, making it easy to introduce bugs. Foo + 4 may do one thing, while &Foo + 4 does something totally different. The compiler does not complain for either of these, making this very hard to debug.\n* User-defined literals allow creating new syntactic forms that are unfamiliar even to experienced C++ programmers. \n\nOverloading also has surprising ramifications. For instance, if a class overloads unary operator&, it cannot safely be forward-declared.\n\n**Decision:**\nIn general, do not overload operators. The assignment operator (`operator=`), in particular, is insidious and should be avoided. You can define functions like `equals()` and `clone()` if you need them. Likewise, avoid the dangerous unary operator& at all costs, if there's any possibility the class might be forward-declared.\n\nDo not overload `operator\"\"`, i.e. do not introduce user-defined literals. \n\nHowever, there may be rare cases where you need to overload an operator to interoperate with templates or \"standard\" C++ classes (such as `operator<< (ostream&, const T&)` for logging). These are acceptable if fully justified, but you should try to avoid these whenever possible. In particular, do not overload `operator==` or `operator<` just so that your class can be used as a key in an STL container; instead, you should create equality and comparison functor types when declaring the container.\n\nSome of the STL algorithms do require you to overload `operator==`, and you may do so in these cases, provided you document why.\n\nSee also Copy Constructors and Function Overloading.\n\n## Access Control\n\nMake data members private, and provide access to them through accessor functions as needed (for technical reasons, we allow data members of a test fixture class to be protected when using Google Test). Typically a variable would be called `_foo` and the accessor function `getFoo()` . You may also want a mutator function `setFoo()` . Exception: static const data members (typically called FOO) need not be private.\n\nThe definitions of accessors are usually inlined in the header file.\n\nSee also Inheritance and Function Names.\n\n## Declaration Order\n\nUse the specified order of declarations within a class: public: before private:, methods before data members (variables), etc.\n\nYour class definition should start with its public: section, followed by its protected: section and then its private: section. If any of these sections are empty, omit them.\n\nWithin each section, the declarations generally should be in the following order:\n\n* Typedefs and Enums\n* Constants (`static const` data members)\n* Creators (`createXXX` methods)\n* Constructors\n* Destructor\n* Methods, including static methods\n* overridden methods (must have the `override` keyword as suffix)\n* Data Members (except `static const` data members)\n\nFriend declarations should always be in the private section, and the `DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN` macro invocation should be at the end of the private: section. It should be the last thing in the class. See Copy Constructors.\n\nMethod definitions in the corresponding .cpp file should be the same as the declaration order, as much as possible.\n\nDo not put large method definitions inline in the class definition. Usually, only trivial or performance-critical, and very short, methods may be defined inline. See Inline Functions for more details.\n\nExample:\n```cpp\nclass MyNode : public Node\n{\n// public first\npublic:\n    // \"creator\" methods first\n    static MyNode *create();\n    static MyNode *createWithParam(const something& arg);\n\n    // If applicable, then Constructors and the Destructor    \n    MyNode();\n    virtual ~MyNode();\n\n    // Then the init methods\n    bool init();\n    bool initWithParam(const something& arg);\n    \n\n    // Then methods of the instance\n    void addColor( const Color& color );\n    void addBackgroundImage( const char* filepath );\n\n    // Then the overrides\n    virtual void visit(void) override;\n    virtual void addChild(Node * child, int zOrder, int tag) override;\n\n// then protected\nprotected:\n    Point absolutePosition();\n\n// then private\nprivate:\n    Point    _lastPosition;\n};\n\n}\n```\n\n## Write Short Functions\n\nPrefer small and focused functions.\n\nWe recognize that long functions are sometimes appropriate, so no hard limit is placed on functions length. If a function exceeds about 40 lines, think about whether it can be broken up without harming the structure of the program.\n\nEven if your long function works perfectly now, someone modifying it in a few months may add new behavior. This could result in bugs that are hard to find. Keeping your functions short and simple makes it easier for other people to read and modify your code.\n\nYou could find long and complicated functions when working with some code. Do not be intimidated by modifying existing code: if working with such a function proves to be difficult, you find that errors are hard to debug, or you want to use a piece of it in several different contexts, consider breaking up the function into smaller and more manageable pieces.\n\n# Other C++ Features\n\n## Ownership and Smart Pointers\n\nPrefer to have single, fixed owners for dynamically allocated objects. Prefer to transfer ownership with smart pointers.\n\n**Definition:**\n\n\"Ownership\" is a bookkeeping technique for managing dynamically allocated memory (and other resources). The owner of a dynamically allocated object is an object or function that is responsible for ensuring that it is deleted when no longer needed. Ownership can sometimes be shared, in which case the last owner is typically responsible for deleting it. Even when ownership is not shared, it can be transferred from one piece of code to another.\n\n\"Smart\" pointers are classes that act like pointers, e.g. by overloading the * and -> operators. Some smart pointer types can be used to automate ownership bookkeeping, to ensure these responsibilities are met. `std::unique_ptr` is a smart pointer type introduced in C++11, which expresses exclusive ownership of a dynamically allocated object; the object is deleted when the `std::unique_ptr` goes out of scope. It cannot be copied, but can be moved to represent ownership transfer. shared_ptr is a smart pointer type which expresses shared ownership of a dynamically allocated object. `shared_ptrs` can be copied; ownership of the object is shared among all copies, and the object is deleted when the last `shared_ptr` is destroyed.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* It's virtually impossible to manage dynamically allocated memory without some sort of ownership logic.\n* Transferring ownership of an object can be cheaper than copying it (if copying it is even possible).\n* Transferring ownership can be simpler than 'borrowing' a pointer or reference, because it reduces the need to coordinate the lifetime of the object between the two users.\n* Smart pointers can improve readability by making ownership logic explicit, self-documenting, and unambiguous.\n* Smart pointers can eliminate manual ownership bookkeeping, simplifying the code and ruling out large classes of errors.\n* For const objects, shared ownership can be a simple and efficient alternative to deep copying.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Ownership must be represented and transferred via pointers (whether smart or plain). Pointer semantics are more complicated than value semantics, especially in APIs: you have to worry not just about ownership, but also aliasing, lifetime, and mutability, among other issues.\n* The performance costs of value semantics are often overestimated, so the performance benefits of ownership transfer might not justify the readability and complexity costs.\n* APIs that transfer ownership force their clients into a single memory management model.\n* Code using smart pointers is less explicit about where the resource releases take place.\n* `std::unique_ptr` expresses ownership transfer using C++11's move semantics, which are generally forbidden in Google code, and may confuse some programmers.\n* Shared ownership can be a tempting alternative to careful ownership design, obfuscating the design of a system.\n* Shared ownership requires explicit bookkeeping at run-time, which can be costly.\n* In some cases (e.g. cyclic references), objects with shared ownership may never be deleted.\n* Smart pointers are not perfect substitutes for plain pointers.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nIf dynamic allocation is necessary, prefer to keep ownership with the code that allocated it. If other code needs access to the object, consider passing it a copy, or passing a pointer or reference without transferring ownership. Prefer to use `std::unique_ptr` to make ownership transfer explicit. For example:\n\n```cpp\nstd::unique_ptr<Foo> FooFactory();\nvoid FooConsumer(std::unique_ptr<Foo> ptr);\n```\n\nDo not design your code to use shared ownership without a very good reason. One such reason is to avoid expensive copy operations, but you should only do this if the performance benefits are significant, and the underlying object is immutable (i.e. `shared_ptr<const Foo>`). If you do use shared ownership, prefer to use shared_ptr.\n\nDo not use `scoped_ptr` in new code unless you need to be compatible with older versions of C++. Never use `linked_ptr` or `std::auto_ptr`. In all three cases, use `std::unique_ptr` instead.\n\n\n## Reference Arguments\n\nAll parameters passed by reference must be labeled `const`.\n\n**Definition:**\nIn C, if a function needs to modify a variable, the parameter must use a pointer, eg int foo(int *pval). In C++, the function can alternatively declare a reference parameter: int foo(int &val).\n\n**Pros:**\nDefining a parameter as reference avoids ugly code like (*pval)++. Necessary for some applications like copy constructors. Makes it clear, unlike with pointers, that a null pointer is not a possible value.\n\n**Cons:**\nReferences can be confusing, as they have value syntax but pointer semantics.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWithin function parameter lists all references must be const:\n\n```cpp\nvoid foo(const string &in, string *out);\n```\n\nIt is a very strong convention that input arguments are values or const references while output arguments are pointers. Input parameters may be const pointers, but we never allow non-const reference parameters except when required by convention, e.g., `swap()` .\n\nHowever, there are some instances where using `const T*` is preferable to `const T&` for input parameters. For example:\n\n* You want to pass in a null pointer.\n* The function saves a pointer or reference to the input.\n* Passing `const char*` for strings\n\nRemember that most of the time input parameters are going to be specified as `const T&` . Using `const T*` instead communicates to the reader that the input is somehow treated differently. So if you choose `const T*` rather than `const T&` , do so for a concrete reason; otherwise it will likely confuse readers by making them look for an explanation that doesn't exist.\n\n## Rvalue references\n\nDo not use rvalue references, `std::forward`, `std::move_iterator`, or `std::move_if_noexcept`. Use the single-argument form of `std::move` only with non-copyable arguments.\n\n**Definition:** Rvalue references are a type of reference that can only bind to temporary objects. The syntax is similar to traditional reference syntax. For example, void f(string&& s); declares a function whose argument is an rvalue reference to a string.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Defining a move constructor (a constructor taking an rvalue reference to the class type) makes it possible to move a value instead of copying it. If `v1` is a `vector<string>`, for example, then `auto v2(std::move(v1))` will probably just result in some simple pointer manipulation instead of copying a large amount of data. In some cases this can result in a major performance improvement.\n* Rvalue references make it possible to write a generic function wrapper that forwards its arguments to another function, and works whether or not its arguments are temporary objects.\n* Rvalue references make it possible to implement types that are moveable but not copyable, which can be useful for types that have no sensible definition of copying but where you might still want to pass them as function arguments, put them in containers, etc.\n* `std::move` is necessary to make effective use of some standard-library types, such as `std::unique_ptr`.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Rvalue references are a relatively new feature (introduced as part of C++11), and not yet widely understood. Rules like reference collapsing, and automatic synthesis of move constructors, are complicated.\n* Rvalue references encourage a programming style that makes heavier use of value semantics. This style is unfamiliar to many developers, and its performance characteristics can be hard to reason about.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nDo not use rvalue references, and do not use the `std::forward` or `std::move_if_noexcept` utility functions (which are essentially just casts to rvalue reference types), or `std::move_iterator`. Use single-argument `std::move` only with objects that are not copyable (e.g. `std::unique_ptr`), or in templated code with objects that might not be copyable.\n\n## Function Overloading\n\nUse overloaded functions (including constructors) only if a reader looking at a call site can get a good idea of what is happening without having to first figure out exactly which overload is being called.\n\n**Definition:**\n\nYou may write a function that takes a `const string&` and overload it with another that takes `const char*` .\n\n```cpp\nclass MyClass\n{\npublic:\n    void analyze(const string &text);\n    void analyze(const char *text, size_t textlen);\n};\n```\n\n**Pros:** Overloading can make code more intuitive by allowing an identically-named function to take different arguments. It may be necessary for templatized code, and it can be convenient for Visitors.\n\n**Cons:** If a function is overloaded by the argument types alone, a reader may have to understand C++'s complex matching rules in order to tell what's going on. Also many people are confused by the semantics of inheritance if a derived class overrides only some of the variants of a function.\n\n**Decision:** If you want to overload a function, consider qualifying the name with some information about the arguments, e.g., `appendString()` , `appendInt()` rather than just `append()` .\n\n## Default Arguments\n\nWe do not allow default function parameters, except in limited situations as explained below. Simulate them with function overloading instead, if appropriate.\n\n**Pros:** Often you have a function that uses default values, but occasionally you want to override the defaults. Default parameters allow an easy way to do this without having to define many functions for the rare exceptions. Compared to overloading the function, default arguments have a cleaner syntax, with less boilerplate and a clearer distinction between 'required' and 'optional' arguments.\n\n**Cons:** Function pointers are confusing in the presence of default arguments, since the function signature often doesn't match the call signature. Adding a default argument to an existing function changes its type, which can cause problems with code taking its address. Adding function overloads avoids these problems. In addition, default parameters may result in bulkier code since they are replicated at every call-site -- as opposed to overloaded functions, where \"the default\" appears only in the function definition.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWhile the cons above are not that onerous, they still outweigh the (small) benefits of default arguments over function overloading. So except as described below, we require all arguments to be explicitly specified.\n\nOne specific exception is when the function is a static function (or in an unnamed namespace) in a .cpp file. In this case, the cons don't apply since the function's use is so localized.\n\nIn particular, the `createXXX` and `initXXX` methods in cocos2dx are allowed to use default arguments.\n\nAnother specific exception is when default arguments are used to simulate variable-length argument lists. Example:\n\n```cpp\n// Support up to 4 params by using a default empty AlphaNum.\nstring strCat(const AlphaNum &a,\n              const AlphaNum &b = gEmptyAlphaNum,\n              const AlphaNum &c = gEmptyAlphaNum,\n              const AlphaNum &d = gEmptyAlphaNum);\n```\n\n## Variable-Length Arrays and alloca()\n\nWe do not allow variable-length arrays or alloca().\n\n**Pros:** Variable-length arrays have natural-looking syntax. Both variable-length arrays and alloca() are very efficient.\n\n**Cons:** Variable-length arrays and alloca are not part of Standard C++. More importantly, they allocate a data-dependent amount of stack space that can trigger difficult-to-find memory overwriting bugs: \"It ran fine on my machine, but dies mysteriously in production\".\n\n**Decision:** Use a safe allocator instead, such as scoped_ptr/scoped_array.\n\n## Friends\n\nWe allow use of friend classes and functions, within reason.\n\nFriends should usually be defined in the same file so that the reader does not have to look in another file to find uses of the private members of a class. A common use of friend is to have a FooBuilder class be a friend of Foo so that it can construct the inner state of Foo correctly, without exposing this state to the world. In some cases it may be useful to make a unittest class a friend of the class it tests.\n\nFriends extend, but do not break, the encapsulation boundary of a class. In some cases this is better than making a member public when you want to give only one other class access to it. However, most classes should interact with other classes solely through their public members.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nWe do not use C++ exceptions.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Exceptions allow higher levels of an application to decide how to handle \"can't happen\" failures in deeply nested functions, without the obscuring and error-prone bookkeeping of error codes.\n* Exceptions are used by most other modern languages. Using them in C++ would make it more consistent with Python, Java, and the C++ that others are familiar with.\n* Some third-party C++ libraries use exceptions, and turning them off internally makes it harder to integrate with those libraries.\n* Exceptions are the only way for a constructor to fail. We can simulate this with a factory function or an `init()` method, but these require heap allocation or a new \"invalid\" state, respectively.\n* Exceptions are really handy in testing frameworks.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* When you add a throw statement to an existing function, you must examine all of its transitive callers. Either they must make at least the basic exception safety guarantee, or they must never catch the exception and be happy with the program terminating as a result. For instance, if f() calls g() calls h(), and h throws an exception that f catches, g has to be careful or it may not clean up properly.\n* More generally, exceptions make the control flow of programs difficult to evaluate by looking at code: functions may return in places you don't expect. This causes maintainability and debugging difficulties. You can minimize this cost via some rules on how and where exceptions can be used, but at the cost of more that a developer needs to know and understand.\n* Exception safety requires both RAII and different coding practices. Lots of supporting machinery is needed to make writing correct exception-safe code easy. Further, to avoid requiring readers to understand the entire call graph, exception-safe code must isolate logic that writes to persistent state into a \"commit\" phase. This will have both benefits and costs (perhaps where you're forced to obfuscate code to isolate the commit). Allowing exceptions would force us to always pay those costs even when they're not worth it.\n* Turning on exceptions adds data to each binary produced, increasing compile time (probably slightly) and possibly increasing address space pressure.\n* The availability of exceptions may encourage developers to throw them when they are not appropriate or recover from them when it's not safe to do so. For example, invalid user input should not cause exceptions to be thrown. We would need to make the style guide even longer to document these restrictions!\n\n**Decision:**\n\nOn their face, the benefits of using exceptions outweigh the costs, especially in new projects. However, for existing code, the introduction of exceptions has implications on all dependent code. If exceptions can be propagated beyond a new project, it also becomes problematic to integrate the new project into existing exception-free code. Because most existing C++ code at Google is not prepared to deal with exceptions, it is comparatively difficult to adopt new code that generates exceptions.\n\nGiven that Google's existing code is not exception-tolerant, the costs of using exceptions are somewhat greater than the costs in a new project. The conversion process would be slow and error-prone. We don't believe that the available alternatives to exceptions, such as error codes and assertions, introduce a significant burden.\n\nOur advice against using exceptions is not predicated on philosophical or moral grounds, but practical ones. Because we'd like to use our open-source projects at Google and it's difficult to do so if those projects use exceptions, we need to advise against exceptions in Google open-source projects as well. Things would probably be different if we had to do it all over again from scratch.\n\nThis prohibition also applies to the exception-related features added in C++11, such as noexcept, `std::exception_ptr`, and `std::nested_exception`. \n\nThere is an exception to this rule (no pun intended) for Windows code.\n\n## Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)\n\ncocos2dx requires Run Time Type Information (RTTI) in order to compile and run. That being said, you should be careful and not abuse the RTTI features.\n\n**Definition:** RTTI allows a programmer to query the C++ class of an object at run time. This is done by use of typeid or dynamic_cast.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nQuerying the type of an object at run-time frequently means a design problem. Needing to know the type of an object at runtime is often an indication that the design of your class hierarchy is flawed.\n\nUndisciplined use of RTTI makes code hard to maintain. It can lead to type-based decision trees or switch statements scattered throughout the code, all of which must be examined when making further changes.\n\n**Pros:**\n\nThe standard alternatives to RTTI (described below) require modification or redesign of the class hierarchy in question. Sometimes such modifications are infeasible or undesirable, particularly in widely-used or mature code.\n\nRTTI can be useful in some unit tests. For example, it is useful in tests of factory classes where the test has to verify that a newly created object has the expected dynamic type. It is also useful in managing the relationship between objects and their mocks.\n\nRTTI is useful when considering multiple abstract objects. Consider\n\n```cpp\nbool Base::equal(Base* other) = 0;\nbool Derived::equal(Base* other)\n{\n    Derived* that = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(other);\n    if (that == NULL)\n        return false;\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n**Decision:**\n\nRTTI has legitimate uses but is prone to abuse, so you must be careful when using it. You may use it freely in unittests, but avoid it when possible in other code. In particular, think twice before using RTTI in new code. If you find yourself needing to write code that behaves differently based on the class of an object, consider one of the following alternatives to querying the type:\n\n* Virtual methods are the preferred way of executing different code paths depending on a specific subclass type. This puts the work within the object itself.\n* If the work belongs outside the object and instead in some processing code, consider a double-dispatch solution, such as the Visitor design pattern. This allows a facility outside the object itself to determine the type of class using the built-in type system.\n\nWhen the logic of a program guarantees that a given instance of a base class is in fact an instance of a particular derived class, then a `dynamic_cast` may be used freely on the object. Usually one can use a `static_cast` as an alternative in such situations.\n\nDecision trees based on type are a strong indication that your code is on the wrong track.\n\n```cpp\nif (typeid(*data) == typeid(D1)) {\n    ...\n} else if (typeid(*data) == typeid(D2)) {\n    ...\n} else if (typeid(*data) == typeid(D3)) {\n    ...\n```\n\nCode such as this usually breaks when additional subclasses are added to the class hierarchy. Moreover, when properties of a subclass change, it is difficult to find and modify all the affected code segments.\n\nDo not hand-implement an RTTI-like workaround. The arguments against RTTI apply just as much to workarounds like class hierarchies with type tags. Moreover, workarounds disguise your true intent.\n\n## Casting\n\nUse C++ casts like `static_cast<>()`. Do not use other cast formats like `int y = (int)x; or int y = int(x);`.\n\n**Definition:** C++ introduced a different cast system from C that distinguishes the types of cast operations.\n\n**Pros:** The problem with C casts is the ambiguity of the operation; sometimes you are doing a conversion (e.g., (int)3.5) and sometimes you are doing a cast (e.g., (int)\"hello\"); C++ casts avoid this. Additionally C++ casts are more visible when searching for them.\n\n**Cons:** The syntax is nasty.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nDo not use C-style casts. Instead, use these C++-style casts.\n\n* Use `static_cast` as the equivalent of a C-style cast that does value conversion, or when you need to explicitly up-cast a pointer from a class to its superclass.\n* Use `const_cast` to remove the const qualifier (see const).\n* Use `reinterpret_cast` to do unsafe conversions of pointer types to and from integer and other pointer types. Use this only if you know what you are doing and you understand the aliasing issues.\n\nSee the RTTI section for guidance on the use of dynamic_cast.\n\n## Streams\n\nUse streams only for logging.\n\n**Definition:** Streams are a replacement for printf() and scanf().\n\n**Pros:** With streams, you do not need to know the type of the object you are printing. You do not have problems with format strings not matching the argument list. (Though with gcc, you do not have that problem with printf either.) Streams have automatic constructors and destructors that open and close the relevant files.\n\n**Cons:** Streams make it difficult to do functionality like pread(). Some formatting (particularly the common format string idiom %.*s) is difficult if not impossible to do efficiently using streams without using printf-like hacks. Streams do not support operator reordering (the %1s directive), which is helpful for internationalization.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nDo not use streams, except where required by a logging interface. Use printf-like routines instead.\n\nThere are various pros and cons to using streams, but in this case, as in many other cases, consistency trumps the debate. Do not use streams in your code.\n\n**Extended Discussion**\n\nThere has been debate on this issue, so this explains the reasoning in greater depth. Recall the Only One Way guiding principle: we want to make sure that whenever we do a certain type of I/O, the code looks the same in all those places. Because of this, we do not want to allow users to decide between using streams or using printf plus Read/Write/etc. Instead, we should settle on one or the other. We made an exception for logging because it is a pretty specialized application, and for historical reasons.\n\nProponents of streams have argued that streams are the obvious choice of the two, but the issue is not actually so clear. For every advantage of streams they point out, there is an equivalent disadvantage. The biggest advantage is that you do not need to know the type of the object to be printing. This is a fair point. But, there is a downside: you can easily use the wrong type, and the compiler will not warn you. It is easy to make this kind of mistake without knowing when using streams.\n\n```cpp\ncout << this;  // Prints the address\ncout << *this;  // Prints the contents\n```\n\nThe compiler does not generate an error because << has been overloaded. We discourage overloading for just this reason.\n\nSome say `printf` formatting is ugly and hard to read, but streams are often no better. Consider the following two fragments, both with the same typo. Which is easier to discover?\n\n```cpp\ncerr << \"Error connecting to '\" << foo->bar()->hostname.first\n     << \":\" << foo->bar()->hostname.second << \": \" << strerror(errno);\n\nfprintf(stderr, \"Error connecting to '%s:%u: %s\",\n        foo->bar()->hostname.first, foo->bar()->hostname.second,\n        strerror(errno));\n```\n\nAnd so on and so forth for any issue you might bring up. (You could argue, \"Things would be better with the right wrappers,\" but if it is true for one scheme, is it not also true for the other? Also, remember the goal is to make the language smaller, not add yet more machinery that someone has to learn.)\n\nEither path would yield different advantages and disadvantages, and there is not a clearly superior solution. The simplicity doctrine mandates we settle on one of them though, and the majority decision was on printf + read/write.\n\n## Preincrement and Predecrement\n\nUse prefix form (++i) of the increment and decrement operators with iterators and other template objects.\n\n**Definition:** When a variable is incremented (++i or i++) or decremented (--i or i--) and the value of the expression is not used, one must decide whether to preincrement (decrement) or postincrement (decrement).\n\n**Pros:** When the return value is ignored, the \"pre\" form (++i) is never less efficient than the \"post\" form (i++), and is often more efficient. This is because post-increment (or decrement) requires a copy of i to be made, which is the value of the expression. If i is an iterator or other non-scalar type, copying i could be expensive. Since the two types of increment behave the same when the value is ignored, why not just always pre-increment?\n\n**Cons:** The tradition developed, in C, of using post-increment when the expression value is not used, especially in for loops. Some find post-increment easier to read, since the \"subject\" (i) precedes the \"verb\" (++), just like in English.\n\n**Decision:** For simple scalar (non-object) values there is no reason to prefer one form and we allow either. For iterators and other template types, use pre-increment.\n\n## Use of const\n\nUse `const` whenever it makes sense. With C++11, `constexpr` is a better choice for some uses of `const`. \n\n**Definition:** Declared variables and parameters can be preceded by the keyword const to indicate the variables are not changed (e.g., `const int foo`). Class functions can have the `const` qualifier to indicate the function does not change the state of the class member variables (e.g., `class Foo { int Bar(char c) const; };`).\n\n**Pros:** Easier for people to understand how variables are being used. Allows the compiler to do better type checking, and, conceivably, generate better code. Helps people convince themselves of program correctness because they know the functions they call are limited in how they can modify your variables. Helps people know what functions are safe to use without locks in multi-threaded programs.\n\n**Cons:** `const` is viral: if you pass a const variable to a function, that function must have `const` in its prototype (or the variable will need a `const_cast`). This can be a particular problem when calling library functions.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n`const` variables, data members, methods and arguments add a level of compile-time type checking; it is better to detect errors as soon as possible. Therefore we strongly recommend that you use `const` whenever it makes sense to do so:\n\n* If a function does not modify an argument passed by reference or by pointer, that argument should be `const`.\n* Declare methods to be `const` whenever possible. Accessors should almost always be `const`. Other methods should be `const` if they do not modify any data members, do not call any non-const methods, and do not return a non-const pointer or non-const reference to a data member.\n* Consider making data members `const` whenever they do not need to be modified after construction.\n\nThe `mutable` keyword is allowed but is unsafe when used with threads, so thread safety should be carefully considered first.\n\n** Where to put the `const` **\n\nSome people favor the form `int const *foo` to `const int* foo`. They argue that this is more readable because it's more consistent: it keeps the rule that `const` always follows the object it's describing. However, this consistency argument doesn't apply in codebases with few deeply-nested pointer expressions since most `const` expressions have only one `const`, and it applies to the underlying value. In such cases, there's no consistency to maintain. Putting the `const` first is arguably more readable, since it follows English in putting the \"adjective\" (const) before the \"noun\" (int).\n\nThat said, while we encourage putting `const` first, we do not require it. But be consistent with the code around you!\n\n## Use of constexpr\n\nIn C++11, use `constexpr` to define true constants or to ensure constant initialization.\n\n**Definition:** Some variables can be declared `constexpr` to indicate the variables are true constants, i.e. fixed at compilation/link time. Some functions and constructors can be declared constexpr which enables them to be used in defining a constexpr variable.\n\n**Pros:** Use of `constexpr` enables definition of constants with floating-point expressions rather than just literals; definition of constants of user-defined types; and definition of constants with function calls.\n\n**Cons:** Prematurely marking something as constexpr may cause migration problems if later on it has to be downgraded. Current restrictions on what is allowed in constexpr functions and constructors may invite obscure workarounds in these definitions.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n`constexpr` definitions enable a more robust specification of the constant parts of an interface. Use `constexpr` to specify true constants and the functions that support their definitions. Avoid complexifying function definitions to enable their use with constexpr. Do not use constexpr to force inlining.\n\n## Use of constexpr\n\nIn C++11, use `constexpr` to define true constants or to ensure constant initialization.\n\n**Definition:** Some variables can be declared constexpr to indicate the variables are true constants, i.e. fixed at compilation/link time.

Use constexpr to specify true constants and the functions that support their definitions. Avoid complexifying function definitions to enable their use with constexpr. Do not use constexpr to force inlining.\n\n\n## Integer Types\n\nOf the built-in C++ integer types, the only one used is `int`. If a program needs a variable of a different size, use a precise-width integer type from `<stdint.h>`, such as `int16_t`. If your variable represents a value that could ever be greater than or equal to 2^31 (2GiB), use a 64-bit type such as `int64_t`. Keep in mind that even if your value won't ever be too large for an `int`, it may be used in intermediate calculations which may require a larger type. When in doubt, choose a larger type.\n\n**Definition:** C++ does not specify the sizes of its integer types. Typically people assume that `short` is 16 bits, `int` is 32 bits, `long` is 32 bits and `long long` is 64 bits.\n\n**Pros:** Uniformity of declaration.\n\n**Cons:** The sizes of integral types in C++ can vary based on compiler and architecture.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n`<stdint.h>` defines types like `int16_t` , `uint32_t` , `int64_t` , etc. You should always use those in preference to `short`, `unsigned long long` and the like, when you need a guarantee on the size of an integer. Of the C integer types, only int should be used. When appropriate, you are welcome to use standard types like `size_t` and `ptrdiff_t` .\n\nWe use `int` very often, for integers we know are not going to be too big, e.g., loop counters. Use plain old `int` for such things. You should assume that an `int` is at least 32 bits, but don't assume that it has more than 32 bits. If you need a 64-bit integer type, use `int64_t` or `uint64_t` .\n\nFor integers we know can be \"big\", use `int64_t` .\n\nYou should not use the unsigned integer types such as `uint32_t`, unless there is a valid reason such as representing a bit pattern rather than a number, or you need defined overflow modulo 2^N. In particular, do not use unsigned types to say a number will never be negative. Instead, use assertions for this.\n\nIf your code is a container that returns a size, be sure to use a type that will accommodate any possible usage of your container. When in doubt, use a larger type rather than a smaller type.\n\nUse care when converting integer types. Integer conversions and promotions can cause non-intuitive behavior.\n\n### On Unsigned Integers\n\nSome people, including some textbook authors, recommend using unsigned types to represent numbers that are never negative. This is intended as a form of self-documentation. However, in C, the advantages of such documentation are outweighed by the real bugs it can introduce. Consider:\n\n```cpp\n// buggy code\nfor (unsigned int i = foo.Length()-1; i >= 0; --i) ...\n```\n\nThis code will never terminate! Sometimes gcc will notice this bug and warn you, but often it will not. Equally bad bugs can occur when comparing signed and unsigned variables. Basically, C's type-promotion scheme causes unsigned types to behave differently than one might expect.\n\nSo, document that a variable is non-negative using assertions. Don't use an unsigned type.\n\n## 64-bit Portability\n\nCode should be 64-bit and 32-bit friendly. Bear in mind problems of printing, comparisons, and structure alignment.\n\n* `printf()` specifiers for some types are not cleanly portable between 32-bit and 64-bit systems. C99 defines some portable format specifiers. Unfortunately, MSVC 7.1 does not understand some of these specifiers and the standard is missing a few, so we have to define our own ugly versions in some cases (in the style of the standard include file inttypes.h):\n\n```cpp\n// printf macros for size_t, in the style of inttypes.h\n#ifdef _LP64\n#define __PRIS_PREFIX \"z\"\n#else\n#define __PRIS_PREFIX\n#endif\n\n// Use these macros after a % in a printf format string\n// to get correct 32/64 bit behavior, like this:\n// size_t size = records.size();\n// printf(\"%\"PRIuS\"\\n\", size);\n\n#define PRIdS __PRIS_PREFIX \"d\"\n#define PRIxS __PRIS_PREFIX \"x\"\n#define PRIuS __PRIS_PREFIX \"u\"\n#define PRIXS __PRIS_PREFIX \"X\"\n#define PRIoS __PRIS_PREFIX \"o\"\n```\n\n* For `void *` (or any pointer) DO NOT USE `%lx`. Instead USE  `%p`\n* For `int64_t` DO NOT USE `%qd, %lld`. Instead USE `%\"PRId64\"`\n* For `uint64_t` DO NOT USE `%qu, %llu, %llx`. Instead USE `%\"PRIu64\", %\"PRIx64\"`\n* For `size_t` DO NOT USE `%u`. Instead USE `%\"PRIuS\", %\"PRIxS`.  C99 specifies `%zu`\n* For `ptrdiff_t` DO NOT USE `%d`. Instead USE `%\"PRIdS\"`. C99 specifies `%td`\n\nNote that the `PRI*` macros expand to independent strings which are concatenated by the compiler. Hence if you are using a non-constant format string, you need to insert the value of the macro into the format, rather than the name. It is still possible, as usual, to include length specifiers, etc., after the % when using the PRI* macros. So, e.g. `printf(\"x = %30\"PRIuS\"\\n\", x)` would expand on 32-bit Linux to `printf(\"x = %30\" \"u\" \"\\n\", x)`, which the compiler will treat as `printf(\"x = %30u\\n\", x)`.\n\n* Remember that `sizeof(void *) != sizeof(int)`. Use `intptr_t` if you want a pointer-sized integer.\n* You may need to be careful with structure alignments, particularly for structures being stored on disk. Any class/structure with a int64_t/uint64_t member will by default end up being 8-byte aligned on a 64-bit system. If you have such structures being shared on disk between 32-bit and 64-bit code, you will need to ensure that they are packed the same on both architectures. Most compilers offer a way to alter structure alignment. For gcc, you can use `__attribute__((packed))`. MSVC offers `#pragma pack()` and `__declspec(align())`.\n* Use the `LL` or `ULL` suffixes as needed to create 64-bit constants. For example:\n\n```cpp\nint64_t my_value = 0x123456789LL;\nuint64_t my_mask = 3ULL << 48;\n```\n\n    If you really need different code on 32-bit and 64-bit systems, use #ifdef _LP64 to choose between the code variants. (But please avoid this if possible, and keep any such changes localized.)\n\n## Preprocessor Macros\n\nBe very cautious with macros. Prefer inline functions, enums, and const variables to macros.\n\nMacros mean that the code you see is not the same as the code the compiler sees. This can introduce unexpected behavior, especially since macros have global scope.\n\nLuckily, macros are not nearly as necessary in C++ as they are in C. Instead of using a macro to inline performance-critical code, use an inline function. Instead of using a macro to store a constant, use a const variable. Instead of using a macro to \"abbreviate\" a long variable name, use a reference. Instead of using a macro to conditionally compile code ... well, don't do that at all (except, of course, for the #define guards to prevent double inclusion of header files). It makes testing much more difficult.\n\nMacros can do things these other techniques cannot, and you do see them in the codebase, especially in the lower-level libraries. And some of their special features (like stringifying, concatenation, and so forth) are not available through the language proper. But before using a macro, consider carefully whether there's a non-macro way to achieve the same result.\n\nThe following usage pattern will avoid many problems with macros; if you use macros, follow it whenever possible:\n\n* Don't define macros in a .h file.\n* `#define` macros right before you use them, and `#undef` them right after.\n* Do not just #undef an existing macro before replacing it with your own; instead, pick a name that's likely to be unique.\n* Try not to use macros that expand to unbalanced C++ constructs, or at least document that behavior well.\n* Prefer not using ## to generate function/class/variable names.\n\n## 0 and nullptr/NULL\n\nUse 0 for integers, 0.0 for reals, nullptr (or NULL) for pointers, and '\\0' for chars.\n\nUse 0 for integers and 0.0 for reals. This is not controversial.\n\nFor pointers (address values), there is a choice between `0`, `NULL`, and `nullptr`. For projects that allow C++11 features, use `nullptr`. For C++03 projects, we prefer `NULL` because it looks like a pointer. In fact, some C++ compilers provide special definitions of `NULL` which enable them to give useful warnings, particularly in situations where `sizeof(NULL)` is not equal to `sizeof(0)`.\n\nUse `'\\0'` for chars. This is the correct type and also makes code more readable.\n\n## sizeof\n\nPrefer `sizeof(varname)` to `sizeof(type)`.\n\nUse `sizeof(varname)` when you take the size of a particular variable. `sizeof(varname)` will update appropriately if someone changes the variable type either now or later. You may use `sizeof(type)` for code unrelated to any particular variable, such as code that manages an external or internal data format where a variable of an appropriate C++ type is not convenient.\n\n```cpp\nStruct data;\nmemset(&data, 0, sizeof(data)); // GOOD\n\nmemset(&data, 0, sizeof(Struct)); // BAD\n\nif (raw_size < sizeof(int)) {\n    LOG(ERROR) << \"compressed record not big enough for count: \" << raw_size;\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\n## auto\n\nUse `auto` to avoid type names that are just clutter. Continue to use manifest type declarations when it helps readability, and never use `auto` for anything but local variables.\n\n**Definition:** In C++11, a variable whose type is given as `auto` will be given a type that matches that of the expression used to initialize it. You can use `auto` either to initialize a variable by copying, or to bind a reference.\n\n```cpp\nvector<string> v;\n...\nauto s1 = v[0];  // Makes a copy of v[0].\nconst auto& s2 = v[0];  // s2 is a reference to v[0].\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n\nC++ type names can sometimes be long and cumbersome, especially when they involve templates or namespaces. In a statement like\n\n```cpp\nsparse_hash_map<string, int>::iterator iter = m.find(val);\n```\n\nthe return type is hard to read, and obscures the primary purpose of the statement. Changing it to\n\n```cpp\nauto iter = m.find(val);\n```\n\nmakes it more readable.\n\nWithout `auto` we are sometimes forced to write a type name twice in the same expression, adding no value for the reader, as in\n\n```cpp\ndiagnostics::ErrorStatus* status = new diagnostics::ErrorStatus(\"xyz\");\n```\n\nUsing `auto` makes it easier to use intermediate variables when appropriate, by reducing the burden of writing their types explicitly.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nSometimes code is clearer when types are manifest, especially when a variable's initialization depends on things that were declared far away. In an expression like\n\n```cpp\nauto i = x.Lookup(key);\n```\n\nit may not be obvious what i's type is, if x was declared hundreds of lines earlier.\n\nProgrammers have to understand the difference between `auto` and `const auto&` or they'll get copies when they didn't mean to.\n\nThe interaction between auto and C++11 brace-initialization can be confusing. The declarations\n\n```cpp\nauto x(3);  // Note: parentheses.\nauto y{3};  // Note: curly braces.\n```\n\nmean different things — x is an int, while y is an initializer_list. The same applies to other normally-invisible proxy types.\n\nIf an `auto` variable is used as part of an interface, e.g. as a constant in a header, then a programmer might change its type while only intending to change its value, leading to a more radical API change than intended.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n`auto` is permitted, for local variables only. Do not use `auto` for file-scope or namespace-scope variables, or for class members. Never assign a braced initializer list to an auto-typed variable.\n\nThe `auto` keyword is also used in an unrelated C++11 feature: it's part of the syntax for a new kind of function declaration with a trailing return type. Function declarations with trailing return types are not permitted.\n\n## Brace Initialization\n\nYou may use brace initialization.\n\nIn C++03, aggregate types (arrays and structs with no constructor) could be initialized using braces.\n\n```cpp\nstruct Point { int x; int y; };\nPoint p = {1, 2};\n```\n\nIn C++11, this syntax has been expanded for use with all other datatypes. The brace initialization form is called braced-init-list. Here are a few examples of its use.\n\n```cpp\n// Vector takes lists of elements.\nvector<string> v{\"foo\", \"bar\"};\n\n// The same, except this form cannot be used if the initializer_list\n// constructor is explicit. You may choose to use either form.\nvector<string> v = {\"foo\", \"bar\"};\n\n// Maps take lists of pairs. Nested braced-init-lists work.\nmap<int, string> m = {{1, \"one\"}, {2, \"2\"}};\n\n// braced-init-lists can be implicitly converted to return types.\nvector<int> testFunction() {\n  return {1, 2, 3};\n}\n\n// Iterate over a braced-init-list.\nfor (int i : {-1, -2, -3}) {}\n\n// Call a function using a braced-init-list.\nvoid testFunction2(vector<int> v) {}\ntestFunction2({1, 2, 3});\n```\n\nUser data types can also define constructors that take initializer_list, which is automatically created from braced-init-list:\n\n```cpp\nclass MyType\n{\npublic:\n    // initializer_list is a reference to the underlying init list,\n    // so it can be passed by value.\n    MyType(initializer_list<int> init_list) {\n      for (int element : init_list) {}\n    }\n};\nMyType m{2, 3, 5, 7};\n```\n\nFinally, brace initialization can also call ordinary constructors of data types that do not have initializer_list constructors.\n\n```cpp\ndouble d{1.23};\n// Calls ordinary constructor as long as MyOtherType has no\n// initializer_list constructor.\nclass MyOtherType\n{\npublic:\n    explicit MyOtherType(string);\n    MyOtherType(int, string);\n};\nMyOtherType m = {1, \"b\"};\n// If the constructor is explicit, you can't use the \"= {}\" form.\nMyOtherType m{\"b\"};\n```\n\nNever assign a braced-init-list to an auto local variable. In the single element case, what this means can be confusing.\n\n```cpp\nauto d = {1.23};        // d is an initializer_list<double>\n\nauto d = double{1.23};  // Good -- d is a double, not an initializer_list.\n```\n\n## Lambda expressions\n\nUse lambda expressions, or the related `std::function` or `std::bind` utilities only in special places like cocos2d callbacks.\n\n**Definition:** Lambda expressions are a concise way of creating anonymous function objects. They're often useful when passing functions as arguments. For example: `std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](string x, string y) { return x[1] < y[1]; });` Lambdas were introduced in C++11 along with a set of utilities for working with function objects, such as the polymorphic wrapper `std::function`.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Lambdas are much more concise than other ways of defining function objects to be passed to STL algorithms, which can be a readability improvement.\n* Lambdas, `std::function`, and `std::bind` can be used in combination as a general purpose callback mechanism; they make it easy to write functions that take bound functions as arguments.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Variable capture in lambdas can be tricky, and might be a new source of dangling-pointer bugs.\n* It's possible for use of lambdas to get out of hand; very long nested anonymous functions can make code harder to understand.\n\nDecision:\n\nUse lambda expressions, or the related `std::function` or `std::bind` utilities only in special places like cocos2d callbacks.\n\n## Boost\n\nDo not use boost.\n\n**Definition:** The Boost library collection is a popular collection of peer-reviewed, free, open-source C++ libraries.\n\n**Pros:** Boost code is generally very high-quality, is widely portable, and fills many important gaps in the C++ standard library, such as type traits, better binders, and better smart pointers. It also provides an implementation of the TR1 extension to the standard library.\n\n**Cons:** Some Boost libraries encourage coding practices which can hamper readability, such as metaprogramming and other advanced template techniques, and an excessively \"functional\" style of programming. It also adds more dependencies in cocos2d-x.\n\n**Decision:**\nIn order to maintain a high level of readability for all contributors who might read and maintain code, and also in order to keep the dependencies as minimal as possible, we do not use Boost.\n\n## C++11\n\nUse libraries and language extensions from C++11 (formerly known as C++0x) when appropriate. Consider portability to other environments before using C++11 features in your project.\n\n**Definition:** C++11 is the latest ISO C++ standard. It contains significant changes both to the language and libraries.\n\n**Pros:** C++11 has become the official standard, and eventually will be supported by most C++ compilers. It standardizes some common C++ extensions that we use already, allows shorthands for some operations, and has some performance and safety improvements.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nThe C++11 standard is substantially more complex than its predecessor (1,300 pages versus 800 pages), and is unfamiliar to many developers. The long-term effects of some features on code readability and maintenance are unknown. We cannot predict when its various features will be implemented uniformly by tools that may be of interest, particularly in the case of projects that are forced to use older versions of tools.\n\nAs with Boost, some C++11 extensions encourage coding practices that hamper readability—for example by removing checked redundancy (such as type names) that may be helpful to readers, or by encouraging template metaprogramming. Other extensions duplicate functionality available through existing mechanisms, which may lead to confusion and conversion costs.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nC++11 features may be used unless specified otherwise. In addition to what's described in the rest of the style guide, the following C++11 features may not be used:\n\n* Functions with trailing return types, e.g. writing `auto foo() -> int;` instead of `int foo();`, because of a desire to preserve stylistic consistency with the many existing function declarations.\n* Compile-time rational numbers (`<ratio>`), because of concerns that it's tied to a more template-heavy interface style.\n* The `<cfenv>` and `<fenv.h>` headers, because many compilers do not support those features reliably.\n\nAdditionaly, any C++11 features that is used, must work on the following compilers:\n\n* Xcode 5.0.2 or newer\n* gcc 4.8 or newer\n* VS 2012 or newer\n\n## General Naming Rules\n\nFunction names, variable names, and filenames should be descriptive; eschew abbreviation.\n\nGive as descriptive a name as possible, within reason. Do not worry about saving horizontal space as it is far more important to make your code immediately understandable by a new reader. Do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not abbreviate by deleting letters within a word.\n\n```cpp\n// OK\nint priceCountReader;     // No abbreviation.\nint numErrors;            // \"num\" is a widespread convention.\nint numDNSConnections;    // Most people know what \"DNS\" stands for.\n```\n\n```cpp\n// BAD\nint n;                     // Meaningless.\nint nerr;                  // Ambiguous abbreviation.\nint nCompConns;            // Ambiguous abbreviation.\nint wgcConnections;        // Only your group knows what this stands for.\nint pcReader;              // Lots of things can be abbreviated \"pc\".\nint cstmrId;               // Deletes internal letters.\n```\n\n## File Names\n\nFilenames should be all in CamelCasel, and for cocos2d specific files, they should start with the `CC` prefix as well.\n\nExamples of acceptable file names:\n\n\n\tCCSprite.cpp\n\tCCTextureCache.cpp\n\tCCTexture2D.cpp\n\nC++ files should end in `.cpp` and header files should end in `.h`.\n\nDo not use filenames that already exist in /usr/include, such as db.h.\n\nIn general, make your filenames very specific. For example, use `CCTexture2D.h` rather than `Texture.h`. A very common case is to have a pair of files called, e.g., `FooBar.h` and `FooBar.cpp` , defining a class called `FooBar` .\n\nInline functions must be in a `.h` file. If your inline functions are very short, they should go directly into your .h file. However, if your inline functions include a lot of code, they may go into a third file that ends in `-inl.h` . In a class with a lot of inline code, your class could have three files:\n\n```cpp\nUrlTable.h       // The class declaration.\nUrlTable.cpp     // The class definition.\nUrlTable-inl.h   // Inline functions that include lots of code.\n```\n\nSee also the section -inl.h Files\n\n## Type Names\n\nType names start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word, with no underscores: `MyExcitingClass`, `MyExcitingEnum`.\n\nThe names of all types — classes, structs, typedefs, and enums — have the same naming convention. Type names should start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word. No underscores. For example:\n\n```cpp\n// classes and structs\nclass UrlTable { ...\nclass UrlTableTester { ...\nstruct UrlTableProperties { ...\n\n// typedefs\ntypedef hash_map<UrlTableProperties *, string> PropertiesMap;\n\n// enums\nenum UrlTableErrors { ...\n```\n\n## Variable Names\n\nVariable names are all camelCase (they start with lowercase). Class member variables have an underscore as prefix. For instance: `myExcitingLocalVariable` , `_myExcitingLocalVariable` .\nAll lowercase variables are accepted as well.\n\n### Common Variable names\n\nFor example:\n\n```cpp\nstring tableName;  // OK - uses camelcase\nstring tablename;   // OK - all lowercase.\n\nstring table_name;   // Bad - uses underscore.\nstring TableNname;   // Bad - starts with Uppercase\n```\n\n### Class Data Members\n\nData members (also called instance variables or member variables) are lowercase with optional underscores like regular variable names, but always end with a trailing underscore.\n\n```cpp\nstring _tableName;   // OK\nstring _tablename;   // OK\n```\n\n### Struct Variables\n\nData members in structs should be named like regular variables without the underscores as prefix that data members in classes have.\n\n```cpp\nstruct UrlTableProperties {\n  string name;\n  int numEntries;\n}\n```\n\nSee Structs vs. Classes for a discussion of when to use a struct versus a class.\n\n### Global Variables\n\nThere are no special requirements for global variables, which should be rare in any case, but if you use one, consider prefixing it with `g_` or some other marker to easily distinguish it from local variables.\n\n## Constant Names\n\nConstant names should all be in UPPERCASE with underscores to separate the words.\n\nDo not use `#define` for consts.\n\nPrefer strongly typed enums over `const` variables, whenever it makes sense.\n\nAll compile-time constants, whether they are declared locally, globally, or as part of a class, follow a slightly different naming convention from other variables. They should be declared in UPPERCASE and use underscore to separate the different words:\n\n```cpp\nconst int MENU_DEFAULT_VALUE = 10;\nconst float GRAVITY = -9.8;\n\nenum class Projection {\n  ORTHOGONAL,\n  PERSPECTIVE\n};\n\nenum class PixelFormat {\n  RGBA_8888,\n  RGBA_4444,\n  RGBA_5551,\n  RGB_565,\n};\n```\n\n## Function Names\n\nRegular functions have mixed case; accessors and mutators match the name of the variable: `myExcitingFunction()`, `myExcitingMethod()`, `getMyExcitingMemberVariable()`, `setMyExcitingMemberVariable`.\n\n### Regular Functions\n\nFunctions should start with lowercase and have a capital letter for each new word. No underscores.\n\nIf your function crashes upon an error, you should append OrDie to the function name. This only applies to functions which could be used by production code and to errors that are reasonably likely to occur during normal operation.\n\n```cpp\naddTableEntry()\ndeleteUrl()\nopenFileOrDie()\n```\n\n### Accessors and Mutators\n\nAccessors and mutators ( `get` and `set` functions) should match the name of the variable they are getting and setting. This shows an excerpt of a class whose instance variable is `_numEntries` .\n\n```cpp\nclass MyClass {\n public:\n  ...\n  int getNumEntries() const { return _numEntries; }\n  void setNumEntries(int numEntries) { _numEntries = numEntries; }\n\n private:\n  int _numEntries;\n};\n```\n\n## Namespace Names\n\nNamespace names are all lower-case, and based on project names and possibly their directory structure: google_awesome_project.\n\nSee Namespaces for a discussion of namespaces and how to name them.\n\n## Enumerator Names\n\nEnumerators should be named either like constants: `ENUM_NAME`.\n\nPrefer strongly typed enums over non-strongly typed enums.\n\n```cpp\nenum class UrlTableErrors {\n  OK = 0,\n  ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY,\n  ERROR_MALFORMED_INPUT,\n};\n```\n\n## Macro Names\n\nYou're not really going to define a macro, are you? If you do, they're like this: CC_MY_MACRO_THAT_SCARES_SMALL_CHILDREN.\n\nPlease see the description of macros; in general macros should not be used. However, if they are absolutely needed, then they should be named with all capitals and underscores, and they should be prefixed with `CC_` or `CC`\n\n```cpp\n#define CC_ROUND(x) ...\n#define CC_PI_ROUNDED 3.0\n#define CCLOG(x) ...\n```\n\n## Exceptions to Naming Rules\n\nIf you are naming something that is analogous to an existing C or C++ entity then you can follow the existing naming convention scheme.\n\n### `bigopen()`\n    \nfunction name, follows form of open() \n\n### `uint`\n\ntypedef \n\n### `bigpos`\n\nstruct or class, follows form of pos \n\n### `sparse_hash_map`\n\nSTL-like entity; follows STL naming conventions \n\n### `LONGLONG_MAX`\n\na constant, as in INT_MAX \n\n# Comments\n\nThough a pain to write, comments are absolutely vital to keeping our code readable. The following rules describe what you should comment and where. But remember: while comments are very important, the best code is self-documenting. Giving sensible names to types and variables is much better than using obscure names that you must then explain through comments.\n\nWhen writing your comments, write for your audience: the next contributor who will need to understand your code. Be generous — the next one may be you!\n\n## Doxygen\n\n* Use Doxygen strings in the header files. Doxygen comments on the implementation file are not required.\n* All public `class` objects MUST have a Doxygen comment that explains what it does.\n* All `public` methods of the class, with the exception of overridden methods, MUST be documented using Doxygen comments.\n* `protected` and `private` methods are suggested to have Doxygen comments, but are not mandatory.\n* Instance variables should NOT have Doxygen comments, unless they are public.\n* Markdown systax is allowed within your Doxygen comments\n\nExample:\n```cpp\n/** `WorldPeace` extends `Node` by adding enough power to create world peace.\n *\n * `WorldPeace` should be used only when the world is about to collapse.\n * Do not create an instance of `WorldPeace` if the `Scene` has a peace level of 5.\n * \n */\nclass WorldPeace : public Node\n{\n\npublic:\n    /** creates a `WorldPeace` with a predefined number of preachers\n     */\n    static WorldPeace* create(int numberOfPreachers);\n\n    /** sets the number of preachers that will try to create the world peace.\n    The more the better. But be aware that corruption might appear if the number if higher than the 20% of the population.\n    */\n    void setNumberOfPreachers(int numberOfPreachers);\n\n    /** displays an aura around the WorldPeace object \n    @see See all `displaySuperAura()`\n    */\n    void displayAura();\n\n    // Overrides\n    virtual void addChild(Node * child) override;\n    virtual void removeChild(Node* child, bool cleanup) override;\n\nprotected:\n    WorldPeace();\n    virtual ~WorldPeace();\n    bool init(int nubmerOfPreachers);\n    \n    int _nubmerOfPreachers;\n};\n```\n\n## Comment Style\n\nUse either the `//` or `/* */` syntax, as long as you are consistent.\n\nYou can use either the `//` or the `/* */` syntax; however, `//` is much more common. Be consistent with how you comment and what style you use where.\n\n## File Comments\n\nStart each file with license boilerplate, followed by a description of its contents.\n\n### Legal Notice and Author Line\n\nEvery file should contain license boilerplate. Choose the appropriate boilerplate for the license used by the project (for example, Apache 2.0, BSD, MIT, etc).\n\nThe license must be compatible for the different App Stores, so GPL and LGPL code cannot be used in cocos2d-x.\n\nIf you make significant changes to a file with an author line, consider deleting the author line.\n\n### File Contents\n\nEvery file should have a comment at the top describing its contents.\n\nGenerally a .h file will describe the classes that are declared in the file with an overview of what they are for and how they are used. A .cpp file should contain more information about implementation details or discussions of tricky algorithms. If you feel the implementation details or a discussion of the algorithms would be useful for someone reading the .h, feel free to put it there instead, but mention in the .cpp that the documentation is in the .h file.\n\nDo not duplicate comments in both the .h and the .cpp. Duplicated comments diverge.\n\n## Class Comments\n\nEvery class definition should have an accompanying comment that describes what it is for and how it should be used. If the class is public (exposed to the users), it should use Doxygen comments.\n\n```cpp\n// Iterates over the contents of a GargantuanTable.  Sample usage:\n//    GargantuanTableIterator* iter = table->NewIterator();\n//    for (iter->Seek(\"foo\"); !iter->done(); iter->Next()) {\n//      process(iter->key(), iter->value());\n//    }\n//    delete iter;\nclass GargantuanTableIterator {\n  ...\n};\n```\n\nIf you have already described a class in detail in the comments at the top of your file feel free to simply state \"See comment at top of file for a complete description\", but be sure to have some sort of comment.\n\nDocument the synchronization assumptions the class makes, if any. If an instance of the class can be accessed by multiple threads, take extra care to document the rules and invariants surrounding multithreaded use.\n\n## Function Comments\n\nDeclaration comments describe use of the function; comments at the definition of a function describe operation.\n\nIf the function is public (exposed to the users), it should be documented using Doxygen comments.\n\n### Function Declarations\n\nEvery function declaration should have comments immediately preceding it that describe what the function does and how to use it. These comments should be descriptive (\"Opens the file\") rather than imperative (\"Open the file\"); the comment describes the function, it does not tell the function what to do. In general, these comments do not describe how the function performs its task. Instead, that should be left to comments in the function definition.\n\nTypes of things to mention in comments at the function declaration:\n\n* What the inputs and outputs are.\n* For class member functions: whether the object remembers reference arguments beyond the duration of the method call, and whether it will free them or not.\n* If the function allocates memory that the caller must free.\n* Whether any of the arguments can be a null pointer.\n* If there are any performance implications of how a function is used.\n* If the function is re-entrant. What are its synchronization assumptions?\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```cpp\n// Returns an iterator for this table.  It is the client's\n// responsibility to delete the iterator when it is done with it,\n// and it must not use the iterator once the GargantuanTable object\n// on which the iterator was created has been deleted.\n//\n// The iterator is initially positioned at the beginning of the table.\n//\n// This method is equivalent to:\n//    Iterator* iter = table->NewIterator();\n//    iter->Seek(\"\");\n//    return iter;\n// If you are going to immediately seek to another place in the\n// returned iterator, it will be faster to use NewIterator()\n// and avoid the extra seek.\nIterator* getIterator() const;\n```\n\nHowever, do not be unnecessarily verbose or state the completely obvious. Notice below that it is not necessary to say \"returns false otherwise\" because this is implied.\n\n```cpp\n/// Returns true if the table cannot hold any more entries.\nbool isTableFull();\n```\n\nWhen commenting constructors and destructors, remember that the person reading your code knows what constructors and destructors are for, so comments that just say something like \"destroys this object\" are not useful. Document what constructors do with their arguments (for example, if they take ownership of pointers), and what cleanup the destructor does. If this is trivial, just skip the comment. It is quite common for destructors not to have a header comment.\n\n### Function Definitions\n\nIf there is anything tricky about how a function does its job, the function definition should have an explanatory comment. For example, in the definition comment you might describe any coding tricks you use, give an overview of the steps you go through, or explain why you chose to implement the function in the way you did rather than using a viable alternative. For instance, you might mention why it must acquire a lock for the first half of the function but why it is not needed for the second half.\n\nNote you should not just repeat the comments given with the function declaration, in the .h file or wherever. It's okay to recapitulate briefly what the function does, but the focus of the comments should be on how it does it.\n\n## Variable Comments\n\nIn general the actual name of the variable should be descriptive enough to give a good idea of what the variable is used for. In certain cases, more comments are required.\n\n### Class Data Members\n\nEach class data member (also called an instance variable or member variable) should have a comment describing what it is used for. If the variable can take sentinel values with special meanings, such as a null pointer or -1, document this. For example:\n\n```cpp\nprivate:\n // Keeps track of the total number of entries in the table.\n // Used to ensure we do not go over the limit. -1 means\n // that we don't yet know how many entries the table has.\n int _numTotalEntries;\n```\n\n### Global Variables\n\nAs with data members, all global variables should have a comment describing what they are and what they are used for. For example:\n\n```cpp\n// The total number of tests cases that we run through in this regression test.\nconst int NUM_TEST_CASES = 6;\n```\n\n## Implementation Comments\n\nIn your implementation you should have comments in tricky, non-obvious, interesting, or important parts of your code.\n\n### Class Data Members\n\nTricky or complicated code blocks should have comments before them. Example:\n\n```cpp\n// Divide result by two, taking into account that x\n// contains the carry from the add.\nfor (int i = 0; i < result->size(); i++) {\n    x = (x << 8) + (*result)[i];\n    (*result)[i] = x >> 1;\n    x &= 1;\n}\n```\n\n### Line Comments\n\nAlso, lines that are non-obvious should get a comment at the end of the line. These end-of-line comments should be separated from the code by 2 spaces. Example:\n\n```cpp\n// If we have enough memory, mmap the data portion too.\nmmap_budget = max<int64>(0, mmap_budget - index_->length());\nif (mmap_budget >= data_size_ && !MmapData(mmap_chunk_bytes, mlock))\n    return;  // Error already logged.\n```\n\nNote that there are both comments that describe what the code is doing, and comments that mention that an error has already been logged when the function returns.\n\nIf you have several comments on subsequent lines, it can often be more readable to line them up:\n\n```cpp\ndoSomething();                  // Comment here so the comments line up.\ndoSomethingElseThatIsLonger();  // Comment here so there are two spaces between\n                                // the code and the comment.\n{ // One space before comment when opening a new scope is allowed,\n  // thus the comment lines up with the following comments and code.\n    doSomethingElse();  // Two spaces before line comments normally.\n}\ndoSomething(); /* For trailing block comments, one space is fine. */\n```\n\n### nullptr/NULL, true/false, 1, 2, 3...\n\nWhen you pass in a null pointer, boolean, or literal integer values to functions, you should consider adding a comment about what they are, or make your code self-documenting by using constants. For example, compare:\n\n```cpp\nbool success = calculateSomething(interesting_value,\n                                  10,\n                                  false,\n                                  NULL);  // What are these arguments??\n```\n\nversus:\n\n```cpp\nbool success = calculateSomething(interesting_value,\n                                  10,     // Default base value.\n                                  false,  // Not the first time we're calling this.\n                                  NULL);  // No callback.\n```\n\nOr alternatively, constants or self-describing variables:\n\n```cpp\nconst int DEFAULT_BASE_VALUE = 10;\nconst bool FIRST_TIME_CALLING = false;\nCallback *nullCallback = NULL;\nbool success = CalculateSomething(interestingValue,\n                                  DEFAULT_BASE_VALUE,\n                                  FIRST_TIME_CALLING,\n                                  nullCallback);\n```\n\n### Don'ts\n\nNote that you should never describe the code itself. Assume that the person reading the code knows C++ better than you do, even though he or she does not know what you are trying to do:\n\n```cpp\n// Now go through the b array and make sure that if i occurs,\n// the next element is i+1.\n...        // Geez.  What a useless comment.\n```\n\n## Punctuation, Spelling and Grammar\n\nPay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is easier to read well-written comments than badly written ones.\n\nComments should be as readable as narrative text, with proper capitalization and punctuation. In many cases, complete sentences are more readable than sentence fragments. Shorter comments, such as comments at the end of a line of code, can sometimes be less formal, but you should be consistent with your style.\n\nAlthough it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point out that you are using a comma when you should be using a semicolon, it is very important that source code maintain a high level of clarity and readability. Proper punctuation, spelling, and grammar help with that goal.\n\n## TODO Comments\n\nUse TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or good-enough but not perfect.\n\nTODOs should include the string TODO in all caps, followed by the name, e-mail address, or other identifier of the person who can best provide context about the problem referenced by the TODO. A colon is optional. The main purpose is to have a consistent TODO format that can be searched to find the person who can provide more details upon request. A TODO is not a commitment that the person referenced will fix the problem. Thus when you create a TODO, it is almost always your name that is given.\n\n```cpp\n// TODO(kl`gmail.com): Use a \"*\" here for concatenation operator.\n// TODO(Zeke) change this to use relations.\n```\n\nIf your TODO is of the form \"At a future date do something\" make sure that you either include a very specific date (\"Fix by November 2005\") or a very specific event (\"Remove this code when all clients can handle XML responses.\").\n\n## Deprecation Comments\n\nUse the `CC_DEPRECATED_ATTRIBUTE` macro to mark an methods as deprecated.\n\nAlso use the ` ``deprecated ` doxygen docstring to mark it as deprecated in the documentation.\n\nA deprecation comment must include simple, clear directions for people to fix their callsites. In C++, you can implement a deprecated function as an inline function that calls the new interface point.\n\nMarking an interface point DEPRECATED will not magically cause any callsites to change. If you want people to actually stop using the deprecated facility, you will have to fix the callsites yourself or recruit a crew to help you.\n\nNew code should not contain calls to deprecated interface points. Use the new interface point instead. If you cannot understand the directions, find the person who created the deprecation and ask them for help using the new interface point.\n\n# Formatting\n\nCoding style and formatting are pretty arbitrary, but a project is much easier to follow if everyone uses the same style. Individuals may not agree with every aspect of the formatting rules, and some of the rules may take some getting used to, but it is important that all project contributors follow the style rules so that they can all read and understand everyone's code easily.\n\nTo help you format code correctly, we've created a settings file for emacs.\n\n## Line Length\n\nEach line of text in your code should be at most 80 characters long.\n\nWe recognize that this rule is controversial, but so much existing code already adheres to it, and we feel that consistency is important.\n\n**Pros:** Those who favor this rule argue that it is rude to force them to resize their windows and there is no need for anything longer. Some folks are used to having several code windows side-by-side, and thus don't have room to widen their windows in any case. People set up their work environment assuming a particular maximum window width, and 80 columns has been the traditional standard. Why change it?\n\n**Cons:** Proponents of change argue that a wider line can make code more readable. The 80-column limit is an hidebound throwback to 1960s mainframes; modern equipment has wide screens that can easily show longer lines.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n80 characters is the maximum.\n\nException: if a comment line contains an example command or a literal URL longer than 80 characters, that line may be longer than 80 characters for ease of cut and paste.\n\nException: an #include statement with a long path may exceed 80 columns. Try to avoid situations where this becomes necessary.\n\nException: you needn't be concerned about header guards that exceed the maximum length.\n\n## Non-ASCII Characters\n\nNon-ASCII characters should be rare, and must use UTF-8 formatting.\n\nYou shouldn't hard-code user-facing text in source, even English, so use of non-ASCII characters should be rare. However, in certain cases it is appropriate to include such words in your code. For example, if your code parses data files from foreign sources, it may be appropriate to hard-code the non-ASCII string(s) used in those data files as delimiters. More commonly, unittest code (which does not need to be localized) might contain non-ASCII strings. In such cases, you should use UTF-8, since that is an encoding understood by most tools able to handle more than just ASCII.\n\nHex encoding is also OK, and encouraged where it enhances readability — for example, `\"\\xEF\\xBB\\xBF\"`, or, even more simply, `u8\"\\uFEFF\"`, is the Unicode zero-width no-break space character, which would be invisible if included in the source as straight UTF-8.\n\nUse the `u8` prefix to guarantee that a string literal containing `\\uXXXX` escape sequences is encoded as UTF-8. Do not use it for strings containing non-ASCII characters encoded as UTF-8, because that will produce incorrect output if the compiler does not interpret the source file as UTF-8.\n\nYou shouldn't use the C++11 `char16_t` and `char32_t` character types, since they're for non-UTF-8 text. For similar reasons you also shouldn't use `wchar_t` (unless you're writing code that interacts with the Windows API, which uses `wchar_t` extensively).\n\n\n## Spaces vs. Tabs\n\nUse only spaces, and indent 4 spaces at a time.\n\nWe use spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs in your code. You should set your editor to emit spaces when you hit the tab key.\n\n## Function Declarations and Definitions\n\nReturn type on the same line as function name, parameters on the same line if they fit.\n\nFunctions look like this:\n\n```cpp\nReturnType ClassName::FunctionName(Type par_name1, Type par_name2)\n{\n    DoSomething();\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nIf you have too much text to fit on one line:\n\n```cpp\nReturnType ClassName::ReallyLongFunctionName(Type par_name1, Type par_name2,\n                                             Type par_name3)\n{\n    DoSomething();\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nor if you cannot fit even the first parameter:\n\n```cpp\nReturnType LongClassName::ReallyReallyReallyLongFunctionName(\n    Type par_name1,  // 4 space indent\n    Type par_name2,\n    Type par_name3)\n{\n    DoSomething();  // 4 space indent\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nSome points to note:\n\n\n* If you cannot fit the return type and the function name on a single line, break between them.\n* If you break after the return type of a function definition, do not indent.\n* The open parenthesis is always on the same line as the function name.\n* There is never a space between the function name and the open parenthesis.\n* There is never a space between the parentheses and the parameters.\n* The open curly brace is always at the end of the same line as the last parameter.\n* The close curly brace is either on the last line by itself or (if other style rules permit) on the same line as the open curly brace.\n* There should be a space between the close parenthesis and the open curly brace.\n* All parameters should be named, with identical names in the declaration and implementation.\n* All parameters should be aligned if possible.\n* Default indentation is 4 spaces.\n* Wrapped parameters have a 4 space indent.\n\nIf some parameters are unused, comment out the variable name in the function definition:\n\n```cpp\n// Always have named parameters in interfaces.\nclass Shape\n{\npublic:\n    virtual void rotate(double radians) = 0;\n}\n\n// Always have named parameters in the declaration.\nclass Circle : public Shape\n{\npublic:\n    virtual void rotate(double radians);\n}\n\n// Comment out unused named parameters in definitions.\nvoid Circle::rotate(double /*radians*/)\n{}\n\n// Bad - if someone wants to implement later, it's not clear what the\n// variable means.\nvoid Circle::rotate(double)\n{}\n```\n\n## Function Calls\n\nOn one line if it fits; otherwise, wrap arguments at the parenthesis.\n\nFunction calls have the following format:\n\n```cpp\nbool retval = doSomething(argument1, argument2, argument3);\n```\n\nIf the arguments do not all fit on one line, they should be broken up onto multiple lines, with each subsequent line aligned with the first argument. Do not add spaces after the open paren or before the close paren:\n\n```cpp\nbool retval = doSomething(averyveryveryverylongargument1,\n                          argument2, argument3);\n```\n\nIf the function has many arguments, consider having one per line if this makes the code more readable:\n\n```cpp\nbool retval = doSomething(argument1,\n                          argument2,\n                          argument3,\n                          argument4);\n```\n\nArguments may optionally all be placed on subsequent lines, with one line per argument:\n\n```cpp\nif (...) {\n    ...\n    ...\n    if (...) {\n        doSomething(\n            argument1,  // 4 space indent\n            argument2,\n            argument3,\n            argument4);\n    }\n```\n\nIn particular, this should be done if the function signature is so long that it cannot fit within the maximum line length.\n\n## Braced Initializer Lists\n\nFormat a braced list exactly like you would format a function call in its place.\n\nIf the braced list follows a name (e.g. a type or variable name), format as if the `{}` were the parentheses of a function call with that name. If there is no name, assume a zero-length name.\n\n```cpp\n// Examples of braced init list on a single line.\nreturn {foo, bar};\nfunctioncall({foo, bar});\npair<int, int> p{foo, bar};\n\n// When you have to wrap.\nSomeFunction(\n    {\"assume a zero-length name before {\"},\n    some_other_function_parameter);\nSomeType variable{\n    some, other, values,\n    {\"assume a zero-length name before {\"},\n    SomeOtherType{\n        \"Very long string requiring the surrounding breaks.\",\n        some, other values},\n    SomeOtherType{\"Slightly shorter string\",\n                  some, other, values}};\nSomeType variable{\n    \"This is too long to fit all in one line\"};\nMyType m = {  // Here, you could also break before {.\n    superlongvariablename1,\n    superlongvariablename2,\n    {short, interior, list},\n    {interiorwrappinglist,\n     interiorwrappinglist2}};\n```\n\n\n## Conditionals\n\nPrefer no spaces inside parentheses. The else keyword belongs on a new line.\n\nThere are two acceptable formats for a basic conditional statement. One includes spaces between the parentheses and the condition, and one does not.\n\nThe most common form is without spaces. Either is fine, but be consistent. If you are modifying a file, use the format that is already present. If you are writing new code, use the format that the other files in that directory or project use. If in doubt and you have no personal preference, do not add the spaces.\n\n```cpp\nif (condition) {  // no spaces inside parentheses\n    ...  // 4 space indent.\n} else if (...) {  // The else goes on the same line as the closing brace.\n    ...\n} else {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nIf you prefer you may add spaces inside the parentheses:\n\n```cpp\nif ( condition ) {  // spaces inside parentheses - rare\n    ...  // 4 space indent.\n} else {  // The else goes on the same line as the closing brace.\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nNote that in all cases you must have a space between the `if` and the open parenthesis. You must also have a space between the close parenthesis and the curly brace, if you're using one.\n\n```cpp\nif(condition)     // Bad - space missing after IF.\nif (condition){   // Bad - space missing before {.\nif(condition){    // Doubly bad.\n\nif (condition) {  // Good - proper space after IF and before {.\n```\n\nShort conditional statements may be written on one line if this enhances readability. You may use this only when the line is brief and the statement does not use the else clause.\n\n```cpp\nif (x == FOO) return new Foo();\nif (x == BAR) return new Bar();\n```\n\nThis is not allowed when the if statement has an `else`:\n\n```cpp\n// Not allowed - IF statement on one line when there is an ELSE clause\nif (x) doThis();\nelse doThat();\n```\n\nIn general, curly braces are not required for single-line statements, but they are allowed if you like them; conditional or loop statements with complex conditions or statements may be more readable with curly braces. Some projects require that an if must always always have an accompanying brace.\n\n```cpp\nif (condition)\n    doSomething();  // 4 space indent.\n\nif (condition) {\n    doSomething();  // 4 space indent.\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if one part of an if-else statement uses curly braces, the other part must too:\n\n```cpp\n// Not allowed - curly on IF but not ELSE\nif (condition) {\n    foo;\n} else\n    bar;\n\n// Not allowed - curly on ELSE but not IF\nif (condition)\n    foo;\nelse {\n    bar;\n}\n\n// Curly braces around both IF and ELSE required because\n// one of the clauses used braces.\nif (condition) {\n    foo;\n} else {\n    bar;\n}\n```\n\n## Loops and Switch Statements\n\nSwitch statements may use braces for blocks. Annotate non-trivial fall-through between cases. Empty loop bodies should use {} or continue.\n\ncase blocks in switch statements can have curly braces or not, depending on your preference. If you do include curly braces they should be placed as shown below.\n\nIf not conditional on an enumerated value, switch statements should always have a default case (in the case of an enumerated value, the compiler will warn you if any values are not handled). If the default case should never execute, simply assert:\n\n```cpp\nswitch (var) {\n    case 0: {    // 4 space indent\n        ...      // 4 space indent\n        break;\n    }\n    case 1: {\n        ...\n        break;\n    }\n    default: {\n       assert(false);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEmpty loop bodies should use `{}` or `continue`, but not a single semicolon.\n\n```cpp\nwhile (condition) {\n    // Repeat test until it returns false.\n}\nfor (int i = 0; i < SOME_NUMBER; ++i) {}  // Good - empty body.\nwhile (condition) continue;  // Good - continue indicates no logic.\n\nwhile (condition);  // Bad - looks like part of do/while loop.\n```\n\n## Pointer and Reference Expressions\n\nNo spaces around period or arrow. Pointer operators do not have trailing spaces.\n\nThe following are examples of correctly-formatted pointer and reference expressions:\n\n```cpp\nx = *p;\np = &x;\nx = r.y;\nx = r->y;\n```\n\nNote that:\n\n* There are no spaces around the period or arrow when accessing a member.\n* Pointer operators have no space after the * or &.\n\nWhen declaring a pointer variable or argument, you may place the asterisk adjacent to either the type or to the variable name:\n\n```cpp\n// These are fine, space preceding.\nchar *c;\nconst string &str;\n\n// These are fine, space following.\nchar* c;    // but remember to do \"char* c, *d, *e, ...;\"!\nconst string& str;\n\nchar * c;  // Bad - spaces on both sides of *\nconst string & str;  // Bad - spaces on both sides of &\n```\n\nYou should do this consistently within a single file, so, when modifying an existing file, use the style in that file.\n\n## Boolean Expressions\n\nWhen you have a boolean expression that is longer than the standard line length, be consistent in how you break up the lines.\n\nIn this example, the logical AND operator is always at the end of the lines:\n\n```cpp\nif (thisOneThing > thisOtherThing &&\n    aThirdThing == aFourthThing &&\n    yetAnother && lastOne) {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nNote that when the code wraps in this example, both of the && logical AND operators are at the end of the line. This is more common in Google code, though wrapping all operators at the beginning of the line is also allowed. Feel free to insert extra parentheses judiciously because they can be very helpful in increasing readability when used appropriately. Also note that you should always use the punctuation operators, such as && and ~, rather than the word operators, such as and and compl.\n\n## Return Values\n\nDo not needlessly surround the return expression with parentheses.\n\nUse parentheses in `return expr;` only where you would use them in `x = expr;`.\n\n```cpp\nreturn result;                  // No parentheses in the simple case.\nreturn (someLongCondition &&    // Parentheses ok to make a complex\n        anotherCondition);      //     expression more readable.\n\nreturn (value);                // You wouldn't write var = (value);\nreturn(result);                // return is not a function!\n```\n\n## Variable and Array Initialization\n\nYour choice of `=`, `()`, or `{}`.\n\nYou may choose between `=`, `()`, and `{}`; the following are all correct:\n\n```cpp\nint x = 3;\nint x(3);\nint x{3};\nstring name = \"Some Name\";\nstring name(\"Some Name\");\nstring name{\"Some Name\"};\n```\n\nBe careful when using the `{}` on a type that takes an initializer_list in one of its constructors. The `{}` syntax prefers the initializer_list constructor whenever possible. To get the non- initializer_list constructor, use `()`.\n\n```cpp\nvector<int> v(100, 1);  // A vector of 100 1s.\nvector<int> v{100, 1};  // A vector of 100, 1.\n```\n\nAlso, the brace form prevents narrowing of integral types. This can prevent some types of programming errors.\n\n```cpp\nint pi(3.14);  // OK -- pi == 3.\nint pi{3.14};  // Compile error: narrowing conversion.\n```\n\n## Preprocessor Directives\n\nThe hash mark that starts a preprocessor directive should always be at the beginning of the line.\n\nEven when preprocessor directives are within the body of indented code, the directives should start at the beginning of the line.\n\n```cpp\n// Good - directives at beginning of line\n  if (lopsidedScore) {\n#if DISASTER_PENDING      // Correct -- Starts at beginning of line\n    dropEverything();\n# if NOTIFY               // OK but not required -- Spaces after #\n    notifyClient();\n# endif\n#endif\n    backToNormal();\n  }\n```\n\n```cpp\n// Bad - indented directives\n  if (lopsidedScore) {\n    #if DISASTER_PENDING  // Wrong!  The \"#if\" should be at beginning of line\n    dropEverything();\n    #endif                // Wrong!  Do not indent \"#endif\"\n    backToNormal();\n  }\n```\n\n## Class Format\n\nSections in public, protected and private order, each indented one space.\n\nThe basic format for a class declaration (lacking the comments, see Class Comments for a discussion of what comments are needed) is:\n\n```cpp\nclass MyClass : public OtherClass\n{\npublic:      // Note the 0 space indent!\n    MyClass();  // Regular 4 space indent.\n    explicit MyClass(int var);\n    ~MyClass() {}\n\n    void someFunction();\n    void someFunctionThatDoesNothing() {\n    }\n\n    void setSomeVar(int var) { _someVar = var; }\n    int getSomeVar() const { return _someVar; }\n\nprivate:\n    bool someInternalFunction();\n\n    int _someVar;\n    int _someOtherVar;\n    DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN(MyClass);\n};\n```\n\nThings to note:\n\n* Any base class name should be on the same line as the subclass name, subject to the 80-column limit.\n* The `public:`, `protected:`, and `private:` keywords should not be indented.\n* Except for the first instance, these keywords should be preceded by a blank line. This rule is optional in small classes.\n* Do not leave a blank line after these keywords.\n* The `public:` section should be first, followed by the `protected:` and finally the `private:` section.\n* See Declaration Order for rules on ordering declarations within each of these sections.\n\n\n## Constructor Initializer Lists\n\nConstructor initializer lists can be all on one line or with subsequent lines indented zero spaces.\n\nThere are two acceptable formats for initializer lists:\n\n```cpp\n// When it all fits on one line:\nMyClass::MyClass(int var) : _someVar(var), _someOtherVar(var + 1) {}\n```\n\nor\n\n```cpp\n// When it requires multiple lines, indent zero spaces, putting the colon on\n// the first initializer line, and commas in new lines if needed:\nMyClass::MyClass(int var)\n: _someVar(var)             // 0 space indent\n, _someOtherVar(var + 1)    // lined up\n{\n    ...\n    doSomething();\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n## Namespace Formatting\n\nThe contents of namespaces are not indented.\n\nNamespaces do not add an extra level of indentation. For example, use:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace {\n\nvoid foo() {  // Correct.  No extra indentation within namespace.\n  ...\n}\n\n}  // namespace\n```\n\nDo not indent within a namespace:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace {\n\n  // Wrong.  Indented when it should not be.\n  void foo() {\n    ...\n  }\n\n}  // namespace\n```\n\nWhen declaring nested namespaces, put each namespace on its own line.\n\n```cpp\nnamespace foo {\nnamespace bar {\n```\n\n## Horizontal Whitespace\n\nUse of horizontal whitespace depends on location. Never put trailing whitespace at the end of a line.\n\n### General\n\n```cpp\nvoid f(bool b) {  // Open braces should always have a space before them.\n    ...\nint i = 0;  // Semicolons usually have no space before them.\nint x[] = { 0 };  // Spaces inside braces for braced-init-list are\nint x[] = {0};    // optional.  If you use them, put them on both sides!\n\n// Spaces around the colon in inheritance and initializer lists.\nclass Foo : public Bar {\npublic:\n    // For inline function implementations, put spaces between the braces\n    // and the implementation itself.\n    Foo(int b) : Bar(), baz_(b) {}  // No spaces inside empty braces.\n    void Reset() { baz_ = 0; }  // Spaces separating braces from implementation.\n    ...\n```\n\nAdding trailing whitespace can cause extra work for others editing the same file, when they merge, as can removing existing trailing whitespace. So: Don't introduce trailing whitespace. Remove it if you're already changing that line, or do it in a separate clean-up operation (preferably when no-one else is working on the file).\n\n### Loops and Conditionals\n\n```cpp\nif (b) {          // Space after the keyword in conditions and loops.\n} else {          // Spaces around else.\n}\nwhile (test) {}   // There is usually no space inside parentheses.\nswitch (i) {\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\nswitch ( i ) {    // Loops and conditions may have spaces inside\nif ( test ) {     // parentheses, but this is rare.  Be consistent.\nfor ( int i = 0; i < 5; ++i ) {\nfor ( ; i < 5 ; ++i) {  // For loops always have a space after the\n    ...                 // semicolon, and may have a space before the\n                        // semicolon.\nfor (auto x : counts) {  // Range-based for loops always have a\n    ...                  // space before and after the colon.\n}\nswitch (i) {\n    case 1:         // No space before colon in a switch case.\n    ...\n    case 2: break;  // Use a space after a colon if there's code after it.\n```\n\n### Operators\n\n```cpp\nx = 0;              // Assignment operators always have spaces around\n                    // them.\nx = -5;             // No spaces separating unary operators and their\n++x;                // arguments.\nif (x && !y)\n    ...\nv = w * x + y / z;  // Binary operators usually have spaces around them,\nv = w*x + y/z;      // but it's okay to remove spaces around factors.\nv = w * (x + z);    // Parentheses should have no spaces inside them.\n```\n\n### Templates and Casts\n\n```cpp\nvector<string> x;           // No spaces inside the angle\ny = static_cast<char*>(x);  // brackets (< and >), before\n                            // <, or between >( in a cast.\nvector<char *> x;           // Spaces between type and pointer are\n                            // okay, but be consistent.\nset<list<string>> x;        // Permitted in C++11 code.\nset<list<string> > x;       // C++03 required a space in > >.\nset< list<string> > x;      // You may optionally use\n                            // symmetric spacing in < <.\n```\n\n## Vertical Whitespace\n\nMinimize use of vertical whitespace.\n\nThis is more a principle than a rule: don't use blank lines when you don't have to. In particular, don't put more than one or two blank lines between functions, resist starting functions with a blank line, don't end functions with a blank line, and be discriminating with your use of blank lines inside functions.\n\nThe basic principle is: The more code that fits on one screen, the easier it is to follow and understand the control flow of the program. Of course, readability can suffer from code being too dense as well as too spread out, so use your judgement. But in general, minimize use of vertical whitespace.\n\nSome rules of thumb to help when blank lines may be useful:\n\n* Blank lines at the beginning or end of a function very rarely help readability.\n* Blank lines inside a chain of if-else blocks may well help readability.\n\n# Exceptions to the Rules\n\nThe coding conventions described above are mandatory. However, like all good rules, these sometimes have exceptions, which we discuss here.\n\n## Existing Non-conformant Code\n\nYou may diverge from the rules when dealing with code that does not conform to this style guide.\n\nIf you find yourself modifying code that was written to specifications other than those presented by this guide, you may have to diverge from these rules in order to stay consistent with the local conventions in that code. If you are in doubt about how to do this, ask the original author or the person currently responsible for the code. Remember that consistency includes local consistency, too.\n\n## Windows Code\n\nWindows programmers have developed their own set of coding conventions, mainly derived from the conventions in Windows headers and other Microsoft code. We want to make it easy for anyone to understand your code, so we have a single set of guidelines for everyone writing C++ on any platform.\n\nIt is worth reiterating a few of the guidelines that you might forget if you are used to the prevalent Windows style:\n\n* Do not use Hungarian notation (for example, naming an integer iNum). Use the Google naming conventions, including the .cpp extension for source files.\n* Windows defines many of its own synonyms for primitive types, such as DWORD, HANDLE, etc. It is perfectly acceptable, and encouraged, that you use these types when calling Windows API functions. Even so, keep as close as you can to the underlying C++ types. For example, use const TCHAR * instead of LPCTSTR.\n* When compiling with Microsoft Visual C++, set the compiler to warning level 3 or higher, and treat all warnings as errors.\n* Do not use #pragma once; instead use the standard Google include guards. The path in the include guards should be relative to the top of your project tree.\n* In fact, do not use any nonstandard extensions, like #pragma and __declspec, unless you absolutely must. Using `__declspec(dllimport)` and `__declspec(dllexport)` is allowed; however, you must use them through macros such as `DLLIMPORT` and `DLLEXPORT` or `CC_DLL`, so that someone can easily disable the extensions if they share the code.\n\nHowever, there are just a few rules that we occasionally need to break on Windows:\n\n* Normally we forbid the use of multiple implementation inheritance; however, it is required when using COM and some ATL/WTL classes. You may use multiple implementation inheritance to implement COM or ATL/WTL classes and interfaces.\n* Although you should not use exceptions in your own code, they are used extensively in the ATL and some STLs, including the one that comes with Visual C++. When using the ATL, you should define _ATL_NO_EXCEPTIONS to disable exceptions. You should investigate whether you can also disable exceptions in your STL, but if not, it is OK to turn on exceptions in the compiler. (Note that this is only to get the STL to compile. You should still not write exception handling code yourself.)\n* The usual way of working with precompiled headers is to include a header file at the top of each source file, typically with a name like StdAfx.h or precompile.h. To make your code easier to share with other projects, avoid including this file explicitly (except in precompile.cpp), and use the /FI compiler option to include the file automatically.\n* Resource headers, which are usually named resource.h and contain only macros, do not need to conform to these style guidelines.\n\n# Parting Words\n\nUse common sense and **BE CONSISTENT**.\n\nIf you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style. If they use spaces around their if clauses, you should, too. If their comments have little boxes of stars around them, make your comments have little boxes of stars around them too.\n\nThe point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are saying, rather than on how you are saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary. But local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, the discontinuity throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Try to avoid this.\n\nOK, enough writing about writing code; the code itself is much more interesting. Have fun!\n\n\n[1]: https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-glwwzmFyUmk/UQgPnlx40uI/AAAAAAAArzg/WPRW10kkecM/s144/cocos2d-x-logo.png\n\n"
