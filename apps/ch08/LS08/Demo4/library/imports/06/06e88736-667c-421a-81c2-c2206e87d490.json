See the definition below\n-   It must follow the _Releases_ rules. See the definition below\n\n## Only _complete_ patches will be merged\n\nThe patch must be _complete_. And by that, we mean:\n\n-   For C++ code follow the [Cocos2d C++ Coding Style][1]\n-   For Python code follow the [PEP8 guidelines][3]\n-   Describe what the patch does\n-   Include test cases if applicable\n-   Include unit tests if applicable\n-   Must be tested in all supported platforms [*]\n-   Must NOT degrade the performance\n-   Must NOT break existing tests cases\n-   Must NOT break the Continuous Integration build\n-   Must NOT break backward compatibility\n-   Must compile WITHOUT warnings\n-   New APIs MUST be **easy to use**, **familiar** to cocos2d-x users\n-   Code MUST be **easy to extend** and **maintain**\n-   Must have documentation: C++ APIs must use Doxygen strings, tools must have a README.md file that describe how to use the tool\n-   Must be efficient (fast / low memory needs)\n-   It must not duplicate existing code, unless the new code deprecates the old one\n-   Patches that refactor key components will only be merged in the next major versions.\n\n[*]: If you don't have access to test your code in all the supported platforms, let us know.\n\n__TBD__: Is this applicable for big features ? What is the best way to merge big features ?\n\n# Promoting cocos2d\n\nHelp us promote cocos2d-x by using the cocos2d logo in your game, or by mentioning cocos2d in the credits.\n\n[Logo Resources of Cocos2d-x][2]\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/docs/CODING_STYLE.md\n[2]: http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Logo_Resources_of_Cocos2d-x\n[3]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008\n"
